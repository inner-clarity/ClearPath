These myths explore deep-rooted â€”but erroneousâ€” beliefs about how unconventional emotional strategies interact with family bonds, whether in childhood, adulthood or in families with trauma histories. Below, <strong>5 common myths</strong> are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.</p><details><summary><strong>1: If you use PRENC at home, it&#39;s because your family &quot;doesn&#39;t take good care of you&quot;.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Using PRENC does not indicate family failure, but emotional self-responsibility. Even in loving families, people with PTSD or other sensitivities need personal tools to regulate their nervous system, something that love alone cannot do.</p></details><details><summary><strong>2: Parents should be the only emotional regulators of their children; PRENCs are not needed.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Although parental co-regulation is fundamental in childhood, teaching children self-regulation strategies (like a &quot;sensory corner&quot; or a security object) gives them emotional autonomy. PRENCs, adapted to their age, are empowerment tools, not substitutes for attachment.</p></details><details><summary><strong>3: If an adult uses PRENC in front of their family, they are &quot;excluding&quot; them or &quot;hiding their emotions&quot;.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Using a PRENC (like breathing deeply or touching a calming stone) can be a way to <strong>avoid impulsive reactions</strong> that damage family communication. It&#39;s not hiding, but an effort to respond from calm, not from trauma.</p></details><details><summary><strong>4: In a &quot;good family&quot;, everyone regulates together; there&#39;s no place for individual practices like PRENCs.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Healthy families balance collective support with respect for individual needs. Some members may need moments or personal tools to feel safe. This doesn&#39;t break unity; it strengthens it with differentiated empathy.</p></details><details><summary><strong>5: PRENCs are &quot;excuses&quot; not to participate in family life.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> On the contrary, many use PRENCs precisely <strong>to be able to participate</strong>: a person with sensory hypersensitivity can use headphones with calming sounds during a noisy family dinner, allowing them to stay present instead of withdrawing from overwhelm.</p></details><hr><blockquote><p>ðŸ”— <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#spiritual-dignity-and-mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Spiritual dignity and mental health</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#nature-of-emotional-regulation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nature of emotional regulation</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
