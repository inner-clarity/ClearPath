However, when a person needs emotional regulation strategies to inhabit their body with peace, myths arise that confuse physiology with social classes. Below, <strong>5 common myths</strong> are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.</p><details><summary><strong>1: PTSD only affects people with low resources.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> PTSD can affect people of any social class. Although certain factors —such as exposure to community violence or lack of access to care— may increase risk in poverty contexts, people with high incomes also suffer traumas (accidents, abuse, disasters, domestic violence, etc.) and develop PTSD.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> This myth can lead to lack of recognition of PTSD in upper classes and denial of mental health resources in low-income communities.</p></details><details><summary><strong>2: Rich people don&#39;t have PTSD because &quot;they have everything&quot;.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Wealth doesn&#39;t protect against trauma. Child abuse, harassment, accidents, sudden loss, or violence can occur in any socioeconomic environment. Additionally, social pressure and emotional isolation in upper classes can even make it harder to recognize suffering.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> This myth can lead to invalidation of suffering in upper classes and lack of emotional support for wealthy people with PTSD.</p></details><details><summary><strong>3: Only poor people experience traumas severe enough to cause PTSD.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> The severity of trauma doesn&#39;t depend on social class, but on subjective perception of threat, helplessness, or horror. An event like a serious medical diagnosis, kidnapping, sexual abuse, or accident can be traumatic regardless of economic status.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> This myth can lead to hierarchization of trauma according to social class, invalidating valid experiences and perpetuating inequality in access to mental health services.</p></details><details><summary><strong>4: Middle-class people don&#39;t suffer PTSD because &quot;they have stability&quot;.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Economic stability doesn&#39;t immunize against trauma. Many middle-class people develop PTSD after events like domestic violence, severe bullying, natural catastrophes, or experiences in the workplace or military.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> This myth can lead to invisibilization of PTSD in the middle class and lack of mental health policies directed at this population group.</p></details><details><summary><strong>5: If you have money, you can &quot;buy the cure&quot; and don&#39;t develop PTSD.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Although access to quality therapy can improve prognosis, PTSD isn&#39;t avoided with money. The response to trauma is neurobiological and psychological, not economic. Even with resources, many people struggle in silence due to stigma or denial.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> This myth can lead to the false belief that money &quot;cures&quot; trauma, delaying necessary treatments and perpetuating silent suffering.</p></details><hr><blockquote><p>🔗 <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#dignidad-espiritual-y-salud-mental" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Spiritual dignity and mental health</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#naturaleza-de-la-regulaci%C3%B3n-emocional" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nature of emotional regulation</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
