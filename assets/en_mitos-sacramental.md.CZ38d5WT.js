However, when a person needs emotional regulation strategies to be present in that moment, misunderstandings arise. Below are <strong>5 common myths</strong> debunked â€”with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.</p><details><summary><strong>1. &quot;If you need a P.R.E.N.C. to be in sacrament meeting, you&#39;re not being reverent.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Reverence isn&#39;t measured by physical stillness, but by the intention of the heart. A person who uses compression clothing, a tactile object, or a regulatory garment does so to be present, not to distract themselves. As <em>InnerSight</em> teaches, emotional regulation allows greater connection with the Spirit, not less.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> External expression is confused with internal devotion, excluding those who need support to participate fully.</p></details><details><summary><strong>2. &quot;You can&#39;t take the sacrament if you use a P.R.E.N.C. because you&#39;re not in a worthy state.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Worthiness to take the sacrament doesn&#39;t depend on the absence of neurological needs, but on repentance, faith in Christ, and desire to renew covenants (<em>InnerSight â€“ Spiritual dignity and mental health</em>). A P.R.E.N.C. can be precisely what allows a person to focus on the meaning of the sacrament, not on their anxiety.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> A non-doctrinal barrier is imposed on access to a central ordinance, generating unnecessary guilt.</p></details><details><summary><strong>3. &quot;If you move, touch an object, or use special clothing during the sacrament, you&#39;re being disrespectful.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Many regulatory movements or gestures (like rubbing a bracelet, adjusting a garment, or rocking gently) are non-verbal strategies to avoid dissociation. Without them, the person could &quot;disconnect&quot; completely and not be present at all.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Self-regulation is interpreted as distraction, when it&#39;s actually an effort to remain in the sacred moment.</p></details><details><summary><strong>4. &quot;The Spirit can&#39;t be with you if you depend on an object during the sacrament.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> The Holy Spirit doesn&#39;t withdraw due to physiological needs, but due to conscious moral decisions. The Savior used mud, saliva, and physical objects to heal (John 9:6); God honors the means that allow His children to access Him.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> &quot;Self-sufficiency&quot; is spiritualized, contradicting the principle that we all need grace, support, and means of grace.</p></details><details><summary><strong>5. &quot;If you can&#39;t sit still like others, you shouldn&#39;t attend sacrament meeting.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Belonging isn&#39;t earned by conformity. <em>InnerSight</em> teaches that ministering with Christ-like love includes creating spaces where everyone can participate, even if they do so in unconventional ways. The presence of a person who regulates with dignity enriches the community, doesn&#39;t disturb it.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> The comfort of the majority is prioritized over the inclusion of the wounded, contradicting the Good Shepherd&#39;s example.</p></details><hr><blockquote><p>ðŸ”— <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#spiritual-dignity-and-mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Spiritual dignity and mental health</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#nature-of-emotional-regulation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nature of emotional regulation</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
