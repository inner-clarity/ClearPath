Below, <strong>5 common myths</strong> are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.</p><details><summary><strong>1: If a PRENC doesn&#39;t eliminate fear completely, it doesn&#39;t work.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> The goal of PRENC isn&#39;t to erase fear, but to <em>modulate its intensity</em> so it&#39;s not overwhelming. Reducing the physiological reaction (tachycardia, sweating, freezing) already allows the person to function, think clearly, and make decisions —something profoundly valuable.</p></details><details><summary><strong>2: PRENC only &quot;distract&quot; from fear, but don&#39;t treat it.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> It&#39;s not about distraction, but about <em>regulation of the nervous system</em>. Techniques like diaphragmatic breathing or contact with textures activate the parasympathetic system, sending safety signals to the brain. This doesn&#39;t avoid fear, but prevents the body from entering panic.</p></details><details><summary><strong>3: If you still feel fear after using a PRENC, it means you failed.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Feeling fear is a normal human response, especially after trauma. The &quot;success&quot; of a PRENC isn&#39;t measured by the absence of fear, but by the capacity to <em>not be paralyzed</em> by it. You can feel fear and, at the same time, be present, speak, or move.</p></details><details><summary><strong>4: Only deep therapy &quot;removes&quot; fear; PRENC are useless palliatives.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Therapy processes the origin of fear; PRENC manage its manifestation in the present. Both are complementary. Without prior regulation, many people can&#39;t even access therapy because fear blocks them. PRENC open the door to treatment.</p></details><details><summary><strong>5: PRENC give a false sense of security that prevents facing real fears.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> On the contrary: by creating a base of internal security, PRENC allow <em>gradual approach</em> to what is feared. For example, a person with fear of public speaking can use a transitional object to calm down and thus practice controlled exposure, not avoid it.</p></details><hr><blockquote><p>🔗 <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#dignidad-espiritual-y-salud-mental" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Spiritual dignity and mental health</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#naturaleza-de-la-regulaci%C3%B3n-emocional" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nature of emotional regulation</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
