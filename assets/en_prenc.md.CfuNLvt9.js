They are adaptive responses deeply rooted in nervous system physiology, which arise when conventional emotional regulation methods (such as conversation, logic, or reflective prayer) are insufficient or unavailable during moments of high dysregulation.</p><hr><h2 id="why-non-conventional" tabindex="-1">Why &quot;non-conventional&quot;? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-non-conventional" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why &quot;non-conventional&quot;?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>They are called &quot;non-conventional&quot; because <strong>they don&#39;t fit traditional emotional regulation models</strong> (such as cognitive restructuring or verbal expression of feelings).
