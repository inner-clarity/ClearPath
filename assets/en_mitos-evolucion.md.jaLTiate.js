Below, <strong>5 common myths</strong> are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.</p><details><summary><strong>1: If you use PRENC today, tomorrow you&#39;ll need strong medication.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> PRENC don&#39;t cause clinical dependence nor &quot;open the door&quot; to more invasive treatments. In fact, many people use them precisely to <em>avoid</em> crises that could require urgent medical interventions. They are preventive tools, not steps toward something worse.</p></details><details><summary><strong>2: PRENC can become obsessive rituals or compulsive behaviors.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Although any repetitive behavior <em>can</em> become dysfunctional in specific contexts (like in OCD), PRENC by themselves don&#39;t cause it. When used with conscious intention and flexibility —not rigidity—, they are adaptive, not pathological.</p></details><details><summary><strong>3: Starting with PRENC leads to rejecting professional therapy and worsening PTSD.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Most people use PRENC as a <em>complement</em> to treatment, not as a substitute. In fact, many therapists recommend them to increase stability between sessions. The risk isn&#39;t in the PRENC, but in lack of access or stigma toward professional help.</p></details><details><summary><strong>4: If a PRENC includes spiritual or symbolic elements, it can lead to delusional beliefs.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Using metaphors, rituals, or visualizations doesn&#39;t imply loss of contact with reality. Millions of healthy people use symbolic practices (like lighting a candle in memory of someone) without psychotic risk. Intention and context determine whether a practice is functional or not.</p></details><details><summary><strong>5: PRENC &quot;mask&quot; the real problem and allow PTSD to worsen in silence.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> On the contrary: by regulating anxiety or dissociation, PRENC allow the person to <em>face</em> trauma with greater clarity and stability. They don&#39;t hide the problem; they create the conditions to address it with greater security.</p></details><hr><blockquote><p>🔗 <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#dignidad-espiritual-y-salud-mental" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Spiritual dignity and mental health</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#naturaleza-de-la-regulaci%C3%B3n-emocional" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nature of emotional regulation</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
