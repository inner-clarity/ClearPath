These myths address erroneous beliefs that teachers, administrators, peers or even students themselves may have about the use of unconventional emotional strategies in learning contexts. Below, <strong>5 common myths</strong> are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.</p><details><summary><strong>1: PRENCs are only for students with clinical diagnosis.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Any student can benefit from emotional regulation strategies, especially in high-pressure contexts (exams, presentations, bullying). Normalizing PRENCs for everyone â€”not just for those with diagnosisâ€” reduces stigma and strengthens collective mental health.</p></details><details><summary><strong>2: If a student needs PRENC, they should be in a different type of school.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Educational inclusion is based on the idea that <strong>all schools must adapt to human diversity</strong>, not the other way around. Using PRENCs demonstrates that the student is trying to participate in the current environment, not that they &quot;don&#39;t belong&quot; to it.</p></details><details><summary><strong>3: PRENCs interfere with the development of school &quot;resilience&quot;.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> True resilience is not enduring discomfort in silence, but <strong>learning to navigate it with effective tools</strong>. PRENCs teach students to recognize their limits and act with self-awareness, a vital skill for academic and personal life.</p></details><details><summary><strong>4: University students &quot;should already overcome&quot; the need for PRENCs.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> PTSD, anxiety or post-traumatic stress don&#39;t disappear with age. Many university students face recent (violence, migration, loss) or untreated traumas. PRENCs allow them to remain in their studies, avoiding dropout due to unregulated emotional crises.</p></details><details><summary><strong>5: Integrating PRENCs in the classroom is &quot;lowering the academic level&quot;.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Quite the opposite: a regulated brain <strong>learns better</strong>. When students feel safe and can self-regulate, they improve their attention, memory and participation. PRENCs don&#39;t subtract academic rigor; they make it accessible to more people.</p></details> --- <blockquote><p>ðŸ”— <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#spiritual-dignity-and-mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Spiritual dignity and mental health</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#nature-of-emotional-regulation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nature of emotional regulation</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
