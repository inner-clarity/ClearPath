It can arise in any geographical context, even decades after trauma, and can affect people of all ages and contexts. However, when a person needs emotional regulation strategies to inhabit their body with peace, myths arise that confuse physiology with cultural aspects. Below, <strong>5 common myths</strong> are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.</p><details><summary><strong>1: PTSD is a &quot;Western&quot; disorder and doesn&#39;t exist in non-Western cultures.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> PTSD has been documented in all regions of the world, regardless of culture. Although ways of expressing suffering may vary (for example, through somatic or spiritual symptoms), the response to trauma is universal. WHO and cross-cultural studies confirm its global presence.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> This myth can lead to denial of suffering in non-Western cultures, preventing access to appropriate treatments and perpetuating cultural stigma.</p></details><details><summary><strong>2: In some cultures, people are &quot;stronger&quot; and don&#39;t develop PTSD.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Resilience varies between individuals, not between cultures. Attributing immunity to trauma to an entire culture is a dangerous stereotype that invisibilizes the real suffering of many people and hinders access to help.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> This stereotype can lead to lack of mental health resources in certain communities and invalidation of individual suffering.</p></details><details><summary><strong>3: If a culture doesn&#39;t have a word for &quot;PTSD&quot;, then it doesn&#39;t exist there.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> The absence of a specific term doesn&#39;t deny the existence of the disorder. Many cultures describe the impact of trauma with local concepts (such as &quot;susto&quot;, &quot;soul pain&quot;, or &quot;fright&quot;), which reflect experiences compatible with PTSD.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> This myth can lead to misdiagnosis or lack of recognition of traumatic symptoms in specific cultural contexts.</p></details><details><summary><strong>4: Only individualistic societies recognize PTSD; collectivist ones &quot;overcome it in community&quot;.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Although community support can be protective, it doesn&#39;t eliminate the risk of PTSD. People in collectivist societies also develop post-traumatic symptoms, although they may express them differently or prioritize group well-being over individual.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> This belief can lead to lack of individualized attention and social pressure to hide symptoms for the benefit of the group.</p></details><details><summary><strong>5: PTSD is a diagnosis imposed by Western psychiatry on other cultures.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> While it&#39;s true that diagnostic systems like the DSM have Western roots, cross-cultural research has validated that core PTSD symptoms (re-experiencing, avoidance, hypervigilance) appear consistently in diverse contexts, adapting to the local cultural framework.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> This myth can lead to rejection of effective treatments and distrust of mental health services in certain cultures.</p></details><hr><blockquote><p>🔗 <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#dignidad-espiritual-y-salud-mental" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Spiritual dignity and mental health</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#naturaleza-de-la-regulaci%C3%B3n-emocional" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nature of emotional regulation</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
