In those moments, emotional regulation strategies like P.R.E.N.C. can be essential to avoid collapse. However, myths arise that stigmatize these needs. Below, <strong>5 common myths</strong> are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.</p><details><summary><strong>1. &quot;After a loss or disaster, everyone must &#39;be strong&#39;; using a P.R.E.N.C. is a sign of weakness.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Grief and trauma from disasters overload the nervous system, and regulatory strategies like P.R.E.N.C. are not weakness, but bodily wisdom to avoid collapse. As <em>InnerSight – Psychological Foundations</em> teaches, emotional regulation is a legitimate adaptive response, not a lack of faith.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> The need for support is stigmatized, leading people to suffer in silence and delay their spiritual and emotional healing.</p></details><details><summary><strong>2. &quot;If you use a P.R.E.N.C. after a tragedy, you&#39;re not trusting in Christ&#39;s Atonement to heal.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Christ&#39;s Atonement doesn&#39;t nullify human physiology, but redeems it within it. Using a P.R.E.N.C. to calm the wounded body doesn&#39;t contradict faith, but allows the soul to access the Spirit&#39;s comfort from a state of greater stability. As <em>InnerSight – Spiritual dignity and mental health</em> affirms, God knows the real needs of His children.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Unnecessary suffering is spiritualized, suggesting that asking for help is distrusting God.</p></details><details><summary><strong>3. &quot;In times of community crisis, there&#39;s no time for &#39;special strategies&#39;; everyone must function the same.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Crises amplify neurological differences and previous wounds. Asking everyone to &quot;function the same&quot; ignores the diversity of the body of Christ. As <em>InnerSight – Institutional Proposal</em> explains, a resilient community is one that supports individual needs to strengthen the whole.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Efficiency is prioritized over compassion, excluding those who most need support to contribute.</p></details><details><summary><strong>4. &quot;The &#39;correct&#39; grief doesn&#39;t include depending on objects; you must overcome it with prayer and faith.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Grief doesn&#39;t have a universal &quot;correct&quot; form. For those who have lost a loved one or survived a disaster, a P.R.E.N.C. can be a symbolic anchor that represents care, containment, or connection with what was lost. As <em>InnerSight – Clinical understanding...</em> teaches, these strategies honor the complexity of human pain.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> A rigid norm of grief is imposed that invalidates legitimate experiences and can generate guilt for not &quot;healing quickly&quot;.</p></details><details><summary><strong>5. &quot;If you need a P.R.E.N.C. after an earthquake, accident, or loss, it&#39;s because you haven&#39;t forgiven or let go of attachment.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Regulatory need doesn&#39;t reflect unresolved spiritual attachment, but physiological activation of the alarm system. Trauma from disasters or complex grief alters the brain and body, regardless of spiritual state. As <em>InnerSight – Impact of demanding abandonment...</em> affirms, demanding that a P.R.E.N.C. be left in these contexts can cause functional deterioration and spiritual distancing.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> A neurological response is moralized, blaming the victim for their physiological suffering.</p></details><hr><blockquote><p>🔗 <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#psychological-foundations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Psychological Foundations</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#impacto-de-exigir-el-abandono-de-estrategias-regulatorias-necesarias" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Impact of demanding abandonment of necessary regulatory strategies</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
