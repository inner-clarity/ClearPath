However, when a leader needs emotional regulation strategies to fulfill their responsibility with peace, myths arise that can prevent their full participation. Below, <strong>5 common myths</strong> are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.</p><details><summary><strong>1. &quot;If you need a P.R.E.N.C., you can&#39;t be a worthy leader in the Church.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> The capacity to lead doesn&#39;t depend on the absence of neurological needs, but on integrity, faith, compassion, and fidelity. As <em>InnerSight</em> affirms, many people with P.R.E.N.C. serve with greater empathy precisely because they understand suffering from within.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Faithful members are excluded from essential callings, limiting the diversity of ministry and contradicting Christ&#39;s example, who called the wounded to heal the wounded.</p></details><details><summary><strong>2. &quot;A leader who uses P.R.E.N.C. can&#39;t be an example to others.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> True example isn&#39;t &quot;normality&quot;, but authenticity, humility, and perseverance in discipleship. A leader who cares for their mental health responsibly models self-regulation, self-awareness, and respect for the body as a temple.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> A disembodied spirituality is idealized that denies human reality and fosters hypocrisy.</p></details><details><summary><strong>3. &quot;If you use a P.R.E.N.C., you can&#39;t give a blessing or administer ordinances.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Authority to administer ordinances comes from the priesthood and ordination, not from sensory conformity. <em>InnerSight</em> teaches that spiritual dignity isn&#39;t measured by the absence of needs, but by a willing heart.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> A non-doctrinal barrier is imposed on the exercise of the priesthood, generating unnecessary exclusion.</p></details><details><summary><strong>4. &quot;Members will think badly of a leader who needs special strategies.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Others&#39; perception doesn&#39;t define spiritual worthiness. Additionally, many members feel more connected to leaders who show authentic vulnerability, because it gives them permission to also be human.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Appearance of perfection is prioritized over the truth of discipleship, distancing those who struggle in silence.</p></details><details><summary><strong>5. &quot;Serving in the Church requires &#39;leaving behind&#39; emotional regulation needs.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Service doesn&#39;t demand denial of the body, but the use of gifts that God has given, including strategies that allow being present, centered, and compassionate. As <em>InnerSight</em> says, demanding abandonment of an essential P.R.E.N.C. can cause functional deterioration and spiritual distancing.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Service is turned into a test of endurance, not an expression of love, which contradicts the commandment to minister with Christ-like love.</p></details><hr><blockquote><p>🔗 <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#dignidad-espiritual-y-salud-mental" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Spiritual dignity and mental health</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#propuesta-institucional" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Institutional Proposal</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
