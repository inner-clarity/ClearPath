This association can generate deep shame, isolation, and spiritual exclusion. Below, <strong>5 common myths</strong> are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.</p><details><summary><strong>1. &quot;If someone uses diapers as a P.R.E.N.C., they must have a fetish.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> The use of diapers in a P.R.E.N.C. is not motivated by sexual attraction, but by need for tactile containment, somatic security, or symbolic repair of broken attachment. The function is regulatory, not erotic.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Confusing neurological need with fetishism invalidates the trauma experience and can generate deep shame or isolation.</p></details><details><summary><strong>2. &quot;P.R.E.N.C. are a disguised form of expressing inappropriate sexual desires.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> P.R.E.N.C. arise from the autonomic nervous system, not from sexual desire. They are responses to emotional or sensory dysregulation, not to erotic impulses.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Self-regulation is pathologized and a physiological need is moralized, contradicting the InnerSight principle: &quot;dignity doesn&#39;t depend on neurological condition&quot;.</p></details><details><summary><strong>3. &quot;If there&#39;s no sexual arousal, it&#39;s not a fetish... but it&#39;s still suspicious.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> The absence of a sexual component is precisely what distinguishes a P.R.E.N.C. from a fetish. In fetishism, the object is necessary for arousal; in P.R.E.N.C., the object is necessary for calm, not for sexual pleasure.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Maintaining suspicion without evidence damages pastoral trust and distances faithful members from the community.</p></details><details><summary><strong>4. &quot;The use of infant underwear or diapers always implies attraction to childhood.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> In the context of P.R.E.N.C., these objects symbolize primary care not received, not attraction to childhood. The person doesn&#39;t seek to &quot;be a child&quot;, but to repair the sensation of bodily abandonment.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> This confusion can lead to unfounded accusations that deeply damage the reputation and faith of an innocent person.</p></details><details><summary><strong>5. &quot;If someone uses P.R.E.N.C. in marital intimacy, they&#39;re introducing fetishism into marriage.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> If the P.R.E.N.C. is used to feel present, safe, and connected during intimacy —not for sexual stimulation—, it enriches the marital connection, not corrupts it. Marital purity is defined by love and fidelity, not by the &quot;normality&quot; of regulatory strategies.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Doctrine is instrumentalized to exclude legitimate forms of intimacy in faithful and loving marriages.</p></details><hr><blockquote><p>🔗 <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#naturaleza-de-la-regulaci%C3%B3n-emocional" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nature of emotional regulation</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#dignidad-espiritual-y-salud-mental" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Spiritual dignity and mental health</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
