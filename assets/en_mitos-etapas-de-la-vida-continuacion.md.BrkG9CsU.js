It can arise at any moment, even decades after trauma, and can affect people of all ages and contexts. However, when a person needs emotional regulation strategies to inhabit their body with peace, myths arise that confuse physiology with spirituality. Below, <strong>5 common myths</strong> are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.</p><details><summary><strong>1: PTSD is exclusive to war veterans or people who have lived through wars.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Any traumatic event â€”like accidents, abuse, natural disasters, domestic violence or serious medical diagnosesâ€” can cause PTSD, regardless of age or life context.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> This prejudice can invisibilize the suffering of people outside the war sphere and limit access to support for other types of victims.</p></details><details><summary><strong>2: Elderly people don&#39;t develop PTSD because they &quot;already overcame everything&quot;.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Aging doesn&#39;t immunize against PTSD. In fact, in old age previously untreated symptoms may emerge, especially when daily distractions (like work) decrease.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Underestimating PTSD in old age prevents adequate care and can worsen isolation, depression or quality of life deterioration in elderly adults.</p></details><details><summary><strong>3: If trauma occurred in childhood, PTSD can only be diagnosed in childhood.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Many adults are diagnosed with complex PTSD derived from childhood traumas that were not identified or treated in time.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Ignoring this reality delays diagnosis, complicates recovery and perpetuates the cycle of discomfort into adulthood.</p></details><details><summary><strong>4: PTSD cannot appear in old age if it never presented before.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Traumatic events in old age â€”like serious falls, intensive hospitalizations or violent death of a loved oneâ€” can trigger PTSD even in people who had never experienced it.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Not paying attention to new symptoms in old age increases the risk that PTSD goes unnoticed and is not treated adequately.</p></details><details><summary><strong>5: PTSD can only develop if trauma occurs in a &quot;vulnerable&quot; stage of life.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> There is no &quot;exclusive vulnerable stage&quot;. Vulnerability to PTSD depends on biological, psychological and social factors, not on a specific time window.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> This myth can lead to underestimating the importance of support for traumas lived outside those supposed &quot;vulnerable stages&quot;, denying attention and understanding.</p></details><hr><blockquote><p>ðŸ”— <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#spiritual-dignity-and-mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Spiritual dignity and mental health</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#nature-of-emotional-regulation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nature of emotional regulation</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
