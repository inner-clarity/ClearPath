These myths explore deep-rooted â€”but erroneousâ€” beliefs about how unconventional emotional strategies interact with family bonds, whether in childhood, adulthood or in families with trauma histories. Below, <strong>5 common myths</strong> are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.</p><details><summary><strong>1: If your family doesn&#39;t understand your PRENC, it&#39;s because they don&#39;t accept you as you are.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Lack of understanding is not always rejection. Many families simply haven&#39;t been exposed to unconventional emotional regulation approaches. With patience and simple explanation (&quot;this helps me calm down, like walking helps you&quot;), they can come to respect it, even if they don&#39;t share it.</p></details><details><summary><strong>2: PRENCs are unnecessary if the family already does therapy or talks about emotions.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Therapy and communication are essential, but not always accessible at the exact moment of an emotional crisis. PRENCs act as &quot;bridges&quot; between sessions or conversations, offering immediate relief and preventing conflict escalation at home.</p></details><details><summary><strong>3: In families with intergenerational trauma, PRENCs &quot;ignore the real problem&quot;.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> PRENCs don&#39;t replace deep family trauma work, but they do <strong>create safe conditions</strong> to address it. A regulated person is more capable of facing difficult conversations without collapsing or attacking. They are a preliminary step, not an evasion.</p></details><details><summary><strong>4: Children shouldn&#39;t use PRENCs because they will &quot;copy strange behaviors&quot;.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> When presented naturally and purposefully (&quot;this helps me calm down, do you want to try something that helps you?&quot;), PRENCs teach children <strong>practical emotional intelligence</strong>. Many develop their own versions: hugging a blanket, drawing their emotions or counting to ten with their fingers.</p></details><details><summary><strong>5: Family love should be enough to &quot;cure&quot; any discomfort; PRENCs are a distraction.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Love is powerful, but it&#39;s not a neurological treatment. Trauma alters the brain and body, and requires specific regulation strategies. PRENCs, used within the context of family love, <strong>enhance healing</strong>, they don&#39;t obstruct it.</p></details><hr><blockquote><p>ðŸ”— <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#spiritual-dignity-and-mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Spiritual dignity and mental health</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#nature-of-emotional-regulation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nature of emotional regulation</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
