It is not a psychiatric, behavioral, or spiritual disorder. It is a <strong>legitimate neurological condition</strong>, with genetic and neurobiological basis, that affects how the brain processes motor and sensory impulses.</p><p>Tics <strong>are not voluntary</strong>, although some people can suppress them temporarily with conscious effort —which generates internal tension and exhaustion. Suppressing tics for prolonged periods is comparable to holding back the need to blink or breathe: possible for a time, but unsustainable and exhausting.</p><hr><h2 id="what-is-a-tic" tabindex="-1">What is a tic? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-a-tic" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is a tic?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A <strong>tic</strong> is a sudden, rapid, repetitive, and non-rhythmic movement (motor) or vocal sound (vocal).
