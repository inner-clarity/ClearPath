When parents support their children&#39;s regulatory needs, they often face judgment or misunderstandings. Below, <strong>5 common myths</strong> are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.</p><details><summary><strong>1. &quot;If your child uses a P.R.E.N.C., it&#39;s because you didn&#39;t discipline them well.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Regulatory needs in children with autism, PTSD-C, or sensory dysregulation are not the result of poor parenting, but of real neurological differences. As <em>InnerSight – Psychological Foundations</em> teaches, these behaviors are adaptive strategies, not rebellion.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Faithful parents are unjustly blamed, generating shame, isolation, and delay in seeking professional support.</p></details><details><summary><strong>2. &quot;Allowing your child to use a P.R.E.N.C. is spoiling or indulging them.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Supporting a child&#39;s regulatory needs is not indulgence, but informed and compassionate parenting. As <em>InnerSight – Guide for Difficult Family Conversations</em> affirms, validating these needs strengthens the child&#39;s emotional security and their ability to relate and learn.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Care is confused with indulgence, leading parents to deny essential support out of fear of judgment.</p></details><details><summary><strong>3. &quot;If you let your child use a P.R.E.N.C., they&#39;ll never learn to regulate like others.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Emotional regulation isn&#39;t taught through imposition, but through modeling, security, and time. A P.R.E.N.C. can be the scaffolding that allows the child to develop other regulatory skills over time. As <em>InnerSight – Psychological Foundations</em> explains, the brain needs stability to learn.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> &quot;Normality&quot; is forced before the nervous system is ready, which can increase anxiety and dysregulation.</p></details><details><summary><strong>4. &quot;Other children will think they&#39;re &#39;weird&#39; and reject them if they use a P.R.E.N.C. in Church.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Exclusion doesn&#39;t arise from the P.R.E.N.C., but from lack of education and empathy in the environment. When leaders and peers understand that these strategies are legitimate forms of self-regulation (<em>InnerSight – Institutional Proposal</em>), children are more accepted, not less.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> &quot;Appearance of normality&quot; is prioritized over Christian inclusion, teaching the child that they must hide their needs to be loved.</p></details><details><summary><strong>5. &quot;A child who needs a P.R.E.N.C. can&#39;t develop a strong testimony.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Testimony doesn&#39;t depend on neurological conformity, but on a willing heart and personal experience with the Spirit. Many children with regulatory needs have deep testimonies precisely because they&#39;ve experienced God&#39;s love in their vulnerability. As <em>InnerSight – Spiritual dignity and mental health</em> teaches, God knows each of His children by name (Isaiah 43:1).<br><strong>Risk:</strong> The child is denied the opportunity to grow in faith from their reality, suggesting that their body distances them from God.</p></details><hr><blockquote><p>🔗 <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#gu%C3%ADa-para-conversaciones-familiares-dif%C3%ADciles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Guide for Difficult Family Conversations</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#psychological-foundations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Psychological Foundations</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
