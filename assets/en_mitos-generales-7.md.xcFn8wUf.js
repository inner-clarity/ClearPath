Each myth is debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.</p><details><summary><strong>61. &quot;It&#39;s outrageous for children to see one of their parents using diapers.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> If explained with simplicity and dignity (&quot;this helps me calm down, like you like your blanket&quot;), children learn empathy, neurological diversity, and respect for others&#39; needs.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Unnecessary shame is transmitted and an opportunity to teach compassion is hidden.</p></details><details><summary><strong>62. &quot;If your daughter sees you using diapers, she&#39;ll be traumatized.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Children don&#39;t get &quot;traumatized&quot; by seeing human needs regulated calmly; they&#39;re traumatized by fear, violence, or emotional incoherence.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Adult stigma is projected onto childhood innocence.</p></details><details><summary><strong>63. &quot;A parent who uses P.R.E.N.C. is not a role model.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Modeling self-regulation, self-care, and emotional honesty is one of the best lessons a parent can give.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> &quot;Normality&quot; is confused with moral integrity.</p></details><details><summary><strong>64. &quot;Children will think it&#39;s wrong not to use diapers if they see their dad with one.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Children understand contextual differences (&quot;this is for dad, you don&#39;t need it&quot;). Confusion only arises if presented with shame or secrecy.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Children&#39;s ability to understand functional diversity is underestimated.</p></details><details><summary><strong>65. &quot;It&#39;s selfish to use P.R.E.N.C. at home because it affects the children.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> An emotionally regulated parent is more present, patient, and available to their children. Taking care of yourself is not selfishness, it&#39;s parental responsibility.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> The caregiver is blamed for prioritizing their stability, which can lead to exhaustion.</p></details><details><summary><strong>66. &quot;Grandparents or visitors will think badly of the family if they see a P.R.E.N.C. in use.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Others&#39; perception shouldn&#39;t dictate the internal health of the home. A family that takes care of itself with dignity teaches more than one that feigns perfection.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Social appearance is prioritized over real well-being.</p></details><details><summary><strong>67. &quot;If children see that their mother needs &#39;help to calm down&#39;, they&#39;ll lose respect for her.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Children respect authenticity, not invulnerability. Seeing a parent manage their emotions with healthy tools fosters security.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> The myth of the &quot;perfect parent&quot; who never needs support is perpetuated.</p></details><details><summary><strong>68. &quot;P.R.E.N.C. in the home confuse children about what&#39;s &#39;normal&#39;.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Real life includes diversity. Children who grow up in inclusive homes develop greater empathy, cognitive flexibility, and resilience.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> An illusion of normality that doesn&#39;t exist outside the home is protected.</p></details><details><summary><strong>69. &quot;It&#39;s better to hide P.R.E.N.C. so as not to worry the children.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Secrecy generates anxiety; calm transparency generates security. Children perceive stress even when nothing is said to them.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> An environment of non-verbal tension is created that children internalize as guilt or danger.</p></details><details><summary><strong>70. &quot;A home with P.R.E.N.C. is not an appropriate environment to raise faithful children.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> A home where the Gospel is lived authentically —including compassion for one&#39;s own needs— is a seedbed of genuine faith.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Holiness is equated with the absence of human needs, contradicting Christ&#39;s example, who healed bodies and souls.</p></details><hr><blockquote><p>🔗 <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#gu%C3%ADa-para-conversaciones-familiares-dif%C3%ADciles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Guide for Difficult Family Conversations</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#dignidad-espiritual-y-salud-mental" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Spiritual dignity and mental health</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
