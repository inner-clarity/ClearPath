However, when a person needs emotional regulation strategies to inhabit their body with peace, myths arise that confuse physiology with spirituality. Below, <strong>5 common myths</strong> are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.</p><details><summary><strong>1. &quot;While you use a P.R.E.N.C., you can&#39;t progress spiritually.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Spiritual progress doesn&#39;t depend on the absence of neurological needs, but on a willing heart, faith in Christ, and the desire to follow Him. As <em>InnerSight – Spiritual dignity and mental health</em> teaches, God knows the real needs of His children and doesn&#39;t demand that they ignore their physiology to demonstrate conversion.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Spiritual growth is conditioned on &quot;normality&quot;, generating guilt, discouragement, and distancing from the Savior.</p></details><details><summary><strong>2. &quot;True repentance requires leaving all forms of &#39;external help&#39;, including P.R.E.N.C.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Repentance is not an act of self-sufficiency, but of humility and dependence on Christ. Using a P.R.E.N.C. to regulate the nervous system doesn&#39;t contradict repentance, but allows the person to be present and receptive to the Spirit, who guides the change of heart (2 Nephi 33:1).<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Somatic regulation is confused with spiritual resistance, leading faithful people to force a &quot;change&quot; that is neither sustainable nor necessary.</p></details><details><summary><strong>3. &quot;If you can&#39;t overcome your need for a P.R.E.N.C., it&#39;s because you haven&#39;t repented enough.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> The need for a P.R.E.N.C. is not a sin that must be &quot;overcome&quot;, but a neurological response to trauma or neurodivergence. As <em>InnerSight – Nature of emotional regulation</em> explains, these strategies are not related to morality, but to the physiology of the nervous system.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> A neurological condition is moralized, blaming the wounded for their wound and distorting the grace of the Gospel.</p></details><details><summary><strong>4. &quot;A truly converted heart doesn&#39;t need objects to feel peace.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Conversion doesn&#39;t eliminate humanity, including the needs of the body. The Savior used mud, saliva, and physical objects to heal (John 9:6); God honors the means that allow His children to access Him. A converted heart may need support to inhabit their body with peace, and that doesn&#39;t diminish their devotion.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> A disembodied spirituality is idealized that denies the reality of the temple of the Spirit (1 Corinthians 3:16–17).</p></details><details><summary><strong>5. &quot;Using a P.R.E.N.C. is an obstacle to the change of heart.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> On the contrary, a P.R.E.N.C. can be the bridge that allows the change of heart, by reducing hypervigilance, dissociation, or anxiety that prevent listening to the Spirit. As <em>InnerSight – Impact of demanding abandonment...</em> affirms, demanding its premature abandonment can cause functional deterioration and spiritual distancing.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> The scaffolding that supports the conversion process is destroyed, confusing the means with the obstacle.</p></details><hr><blockquote><p>🔗 <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#dignidad-espiritual-y-salud-mental" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Spiritual dignity and mental health</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#naturaleza-de-la-regulaci%C3%B3n-emocional" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nature of emotional regulation</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
