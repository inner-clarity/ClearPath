However, when a servant needs emotional regulation strategies to maintain their stability in demanding environments, myths arise that can prevent their full participation. Below, <strong>5 common myths</strong> are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.</p><details><summary><strong>1. &quot;A missionary who needs a P.R.E.N.C. is not spiritually prepared to serve.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Missionary preparation isn&#39;t measured by the absence of neurological needs, but by faith, desire to serve, and capacity to follow mission rules. As <em>InnerSight – Institutional Proposal</em> affirms, many missionaries with regulatory needs have served with excellence, empathy, and fidelity, precisely because they understand suffering from within.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> A sacred service opportunity is denied based on non-doctrinal criteria, limiting the potential of the Kingdom.</p></details><details><summary><strong>2. &quot;You can&#39;t serve far from home if you depend on objects or special strategies to calm down.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Autonomy doesn&#39;t mean absolute self-sufficiency, but capacity to manage one&#39;s own needs responsibly. A missionary who carries a discrete regulatory object (like a tactile bracelet or compression underwear) demonstrates maturity by anticipating their needs, not weakness.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> An image of an &quot;invulnerable&quot; missionary is idealized, excluding those who could serve with great compassion.</p></details><details><summary><strong>3. &quot;If you use a P.R.E.N.C. on the mission, your companions will think you&#39;re &#39;broken&#39; or not worthy.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Others&#39; perception doesn&#39;t define spiritual worthiness. Additionally, many mission companions respond with empathy when it&#39;s explained simply that certain strategies allow greater presence and focus on the work. As <em>InnerSight – Purpose</em> teaches, ministering includes creating communities where everyone can serve according to their gifts.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Fear of judgment leads to hiding needs, which can result in exhaustion, anxiety, or emotional collapse in the field.</p></details><details><summary><strong>4. &quot;Mission rules prohibit any form of &#39;external help&#39; for emotional regulation.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Mission rules don&#39;t prohibit discrete and non-disruptive regulatory strategies. In fact, mission leaders are trained to support reasonable accommodations that allow missionaries to fulfill their calling with mental health. As <em>InnerSight – Frequently Asked Questions for Leaders</em> says, worthiness to serve doesn&#39;t depend on neurological &quot;normality&quot;.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> A prohibition that doesn&#39;t exist is assumed, depriving the missionary of tools that could prevent crises and strengthen their testimony.</p></details><details><summary><strong>5. &quot;If you need a P.R.E.N.C., your testimony isn&#39;t strong enough to withstand mission challenges.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Testimony isn&#39;t measured by resistance to suffering, but by faith in Christ and willingness to follow Him. Many missionaries with PTSD-C, autism, or anxiety have given powerful testimonies precisely because they&#39;ve experienced God&#39;s grace in their fragility. As <em>InnerSight – Spiritual dignity and mental health</em> teaches, God strengthens the weak (Ether 12:27), not just the &quot;strong&quot;.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Human vulnerability is confused with lack of faith, contradicting the central message of the Gospel.</p></details><hr><blockquote><p>🔗 <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#propuesta-institucional" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Institutional Proposal</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#preguntas-frecuentes-para-l%C3%ADderes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Frequently Asked Questions for Leaders</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
