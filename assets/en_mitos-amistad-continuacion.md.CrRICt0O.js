These myths explore erroneous beliefs about how the use of unconventional emotional strategies impacts (or doesn&#39;t) friendship relationships. However, when a person needs emotional regulation strategies to inhabit their body with peace, myths arise that confuse physiology in friendship bonds. Below, <strong>5 common myths</strong> are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.</p><details><summary><strong>1: &quot;Normal&quot; friendships don&#39;t include rituals or unconventional emotional practices.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Many friendships develop their own healing rituals: walking in silence, writing emotional letters, watching the sunset together or even creating a &quot;safety code&quot; for crisis moments. These are shared PRENCs, and they strengthen the bond.</p></details><details><summary><strong>2: If a friend doesn&#39;t accept your PRENC, they&#39;re not a true friend.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Friendship doesn&#39;t require total approval, but basic respect. Some friends may not understand your PRENC, but they can respect your space. Judging their &quot;true friendship&quot; only by this can be unfair; education and dialogue are key.</p></details><details><summary><strong>3: Using PRENC in groups (like in meetings) is antisocial or selfish.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Discreetly integrating a PRENC (like using a sensory ring or practicing mindfulness for a few seconds) can be a form of social self-care: it allows you to stay in the group without disconnecting from overstimulation or anxiety.</p></details><details><summary><strong>4: PRENCs are only for crisis moments, they have no place in shared joy with friends.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Some PRENCs are also used to <strong>amplify joy</strong> or connection: dancing freely together, creating spontaneous art, or sharing a &quot;gratitude mantra&quot;. Emotional regulation is not just for pain, but for fully living any emotion.</p></details><details><summary><strong>5: If you use PRENC, your friends will think you&#39;re &quot;broken&quot; or &quot;too sensitive&quot;.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> That perception says more about others&#39; prejudices than about you. More and more people value emotional intelligence and self-regulation as signs of strength. Sharing your PRENCs with close friends can even inspire them to explore their own tools.</p></details><hr><blockquote><p>ðŸ”— <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#spiritual-dignity-and-mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Spiritual dignity and mental health</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#nature-of-emotional-regulation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nature of emotional regulation</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
