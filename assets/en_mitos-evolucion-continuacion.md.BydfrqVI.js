Below, <strong>5 common myths</strong> are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.</p><details><summary><strong>1: Over time, PRENCs become ineffective and the person needs &quot;something more extreme&quot;.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> The effectiveness of a PRENC can vary over time, like any tool. But that doesn&#39;t mean it &quot;evolves into something worse&quot;; it simply indicates the need to adjust the strategy, something normal in any emotional growth process.</p></details><details><summary><strong>2: Using PRENC fosters emotional avoidance, which leads to future collapse.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Well-applied PRENCs don&#39;t avoid emotions, but help to <em>regulate intensity</em> to be able to process them without collapsing. Avoiding pain is different from modulating it. Conscious regulation is a preliminary step to processing, not an escape.</p></details><details><summary><strong>3: If a child uses PRENC, they will develop emotional dependency on objects or rituals.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Children use transitional objects naturally (stuffed animals, blankets). PRENCs adapted to their age foster self-regulation and internal security. With support, these are internalized over time, not chronified as pathological dependencies.</p></details><details><summary><strong>4: PRENCs can &quot;activate&quot; repressed traumatic memories and cause a crisis.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Some sensory PRENCs (like certain smells or sounds) could act as triggers, but that&#39;s not the PRENC&#39;s fault itself, but the nature of trauma. That&#39;s why it&#39;s key to choose PRENCs with self-awareness or professional guidance. Most are designed precisely to <em>prevent</em> re-experiencing, not provoke it.</p></details><details><summary><strong>5: If something works &quot;too well&quot;, there must be a hidden risk.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> This belief reflects a cultural bias against accessible emotional relief. Not everything simple is dangerous. Many PRENCs work because they align with basic human needs: security, sensory connection, rhythm, symbolism. Their effectiveness doesn&#39;t imply trap or hidden consequence.</p></details> --- <blockquote><p>ðŸ”— <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#spiritual-dignity-and-mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Spiritual dignity and mental health</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#nature-of-emotional-regulation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nature of emotional regulation</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
