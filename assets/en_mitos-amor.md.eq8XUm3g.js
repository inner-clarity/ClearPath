However, when a person needs emotional regulation strategies to inhabit their body with peace, myths arise that confuse physiology with the replacement of love. Below, <strong>5 common myths</strong> are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.</p><details><summary><strong>1: If you use PRENC in a relationship, it&#39;s because your partner &quot;isn&#39;t enough for you&quot;.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Love does not eliminate the need for self-regulation. People with PTSD (or other emotional wounds) can love their partner deeply and, at the same time, require personal tools to manage their nervous system. PRENC complements the bond, it doesn&#39;t replace it.</p></details><details><summary><strong>2: A loving partner should be your only &quot;PRENC&quot;.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Loading a partner with total responsibility for your emotional regulation can generate emotional dependency, relational exhaustion and loss of autonomy. PRENCs foster self-regulation, which actually strengthens healthy relationships.</p></details><details><summary><strong>3: If your partner doesn&#39;t understand your PRENC, they don&#39;t really love you.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Love does not imply automatic understanding of every personal tool. What matters is mutual disposition to dialogue, respect and curiosity. Many couples learn together about PRENCs with time and empathy.</p></details><details><summary><strong>4: Using PRENC as a couple (like shared rituals) is &quot;weird&quot; or unromantic.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Many couples find in PRENCs intimate ways of connection: meditating together, walking in silence, creating shared emotional art or using shared mantras. These practices can deepen emotional intimacy and mutual security.</p></details><details><summary><strong>Myth 5: Love cures PTSD, so you don&#39;t need PRENC if you&#39;re in a healthy relationship.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Although secure love is a powerful protective factor, it doesn&#39;t &quot;cure&quot; PTSD by itself. Trauma is stored in the body and nervous system, and requires specific regulation strategies. PRENC, along with loving support, creates a more favorable environment for healing.</p></details><hr><blockquote><p>ðŸ”— <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#spiritual-dignity-and-mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Spiritual dignity and mental health</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#nature-of-emotional-regulation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nature of emotional regulation</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
