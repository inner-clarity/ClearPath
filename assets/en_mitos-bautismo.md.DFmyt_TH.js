However, when a child needs emotional regulation strategies to participate peacefully in these moments, doubts and myths arise that can unnecessarily delay their access to essential blessings. Below, <strong>5 common myths</strong> are debunked with clinical and doctrinal foundation.</p><details><summary><strong>1. &quot;If a child needs a P.R.E.N.C., they&#39;re not spiritually ready for baptism.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Preparation for baptism doesn&#39;t depend on sensory or emotional conformity, but on the ability to discern good from evil and the desire to follow Christ (Moroni 8:9–10). A child who uses a P.R.E.N.C. can deeply understand the meaning of the covenant, even if their nervous system needs support to regulate during the ceremony.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> A saving ordinance is denied based on non-doctrinal criteria, unnecessarily delaying the child&#39;s formal belonging to the Kingdom.</p></details><details><summary><strong>2. &quot;Using diapers, special clothing, or regulatory objects makes the confirmation less valid.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> The validity of an ordinance depends on priesthood authority and the intention of the heart, not on the absence of neurological needs. As <em>InnerSight</em> teaches, the Holy Spirit doesn&#39;t withdraw due to legitimate physiological needs.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> A logic of &quot;ritual purity&quot; is introduced that contradicts the grace of the Gospel and generates anxiety in faithful families.</p></details><details><summary><strong>3. &quot;If a child moves, touches an object, or uses unconventional clothing during baptism, they&#39;re not respecting the sacred moment.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Many regulatory movements or gestures are strategies to avoid sensory overload or dissociation in a new, noisy, or overwhelming environment. Without them, the child could experience extreme distress or total disconnection, preventing them from participating meaningfully.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Self-regulation is interpreted as lack of reverence, when in reality it&#39;s an effort to be present in a sacred moment.</p></details><details><summary><strong>4. &quot;Leaders will think parents didn&#39;t prepare their child well if they need a P.R.E.N.C. during baptism.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Spiritual preparation doesn&#39;t include &quot;teaching the child to regulate like others&quot;, but helping them understand the covenant in their own language and capacity. As <em>InnerSight – Guide for Difficult Family Conversations</em> affirms, parents who support their children&#39;s regulatory needs prepare them better, not worse.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Fear of judgment leads families to hide legitimate needs, depriving the child of the support they need to fully live their spiritual experience.</p></details><details><summary><strong>5. &quot;A child who needs a P.R.E.N.C. can&#39;t receive the gift of the Holy Ghost because they&#39;re not &#39;calm&#39;.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> The Holy Ghost doesn&#39;t require physical stillness, but a willing heart. The Savior blessed children who cried, ran, and moved (3 Nephi 17:21–24); God knows the real needs of His little children.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Neurological expression is confused with spiritual disposition, denying the child an essential blessing for reasons unrelated to doctrine.</p></details><hr><blockquote><p>🔗 <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#dignidad-espiritual-y-salud-mental" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Spiritual dignity and mental health</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#gu%C3%ADa-para-conversaciones-familiares-dif%C3%ADciles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Guide for Difficult Family Conversations</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
