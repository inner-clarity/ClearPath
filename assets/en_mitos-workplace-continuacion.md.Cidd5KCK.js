However, when a person needs emotional regulation strategies to inhabit their body with peace, myths arise that confuse physiology with workplace performance. Below, <strong>5 common myths</strong> are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.</p><details><summary><strong>1: If a person uses PRENC, they can&#39;t handle high-pressure positions.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Many people with PTSD who use PRENCs perform demanding roles in medicine, emergencies, education or leadership. Their strategies allow them to manage accumulated stress and maintain sustainable high performance.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> This myth can limit opportunities for professional growth and perpetuate discrimination in positions of responsibility.</p></details><details><summary><strong>2: PRENCs have no scientific basis, so they shouldn&#39;t be used at work.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Although some PRENCs are not formally validated, many are based on supported principles (like sensory stimulation, connection with nature or creative expression). What&#39;s relevant is whether the strategy helps the person function without interfering with others.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Rejecting effective strategies based solely on formal validation criteria can deprive people of tools that work for them.</p></details><details><summary><strong>3: Allowing PRENCs at work creates unfair &quot;special treatment&quot;.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Reasonable accommodations (like brief pauses or use of headphones to reduce overstimulation) are not privileges, but necessary adjustments to ensure equity. Just as an ergonomic chair is allowed for someone with back pain, a PRENC can be allowed for someone regulating their post-traumatic anxiety.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> This myth can create an inequitable work environment that denies necessary accommodations for the inclusion and well-being of all employees.</p></details><details><summary><strong>4: If the PRENC works, the person no longer needs professional treatment.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> PRENCs are usually complements, not substitutes, for clinical treatment. A person can use PRENCs at work while continuing therapy, and this reflects a comprehensive approach, not inadequate dependency.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> This confusion can lead to interrupting necessary treatments or not seeking professional help when required, worsening symptoms.</p></details><details><summary><strong>5: Using PRENC at work reveals weakness or mental instability.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> On the contrary: using PRENCs demonstrates self-regulation, responsibility and commitment to the work environment. It&#39;s an act of strength to actively manage PTSD&#39;s impact to continue contributing effectively.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> This stigma can lead to self-stigmatization, reducing self-esteem and confidence in one&#39;s own work capabilities.</p></details><hr><blockquote><p>ðŸ”— <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#spiritual-dignity-and-mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Spiritual dignity and mental health</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#nature-of-emotional-regulation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nature of emotional regulation</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
