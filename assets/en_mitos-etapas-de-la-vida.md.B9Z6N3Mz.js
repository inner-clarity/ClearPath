It can arise at any time, even decades after trauma, and can affect people of all ages and contexts. However, when a person needs emotional regulation strategies to inhabit their body with peace, myths arise that confuse physiology with spirituality. Below, <strong>5 common myths</strong> are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.</p><details><summary><strong>1: PTSD only appears shortly after trauma.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Although many develop symptoms in the first months, PTSD can manifest even years after the traumatic event. This is known as <em>delayed-onset PTSD</em>.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> This myth can lead to underestimation of symptoms that appear after a long time, delaying diagnosis and access to necessary help.</p></details><details><summary><strong>2: If you don&#39;t have symptoms immediately, you won&#39;t develop PTSD.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Initial absence of symptoms doesn&#39;t rule out future development of the disorder. Factors like accumulated stress, life changes, or new triggers can activate PTSD later.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Minimizing vigilance and psychological support after a traumatic event can leave the person unprotected against a delayed onset of PTSD.</p></details><details><summary><strong>3: Only young adults can suffer PTSD.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> PTSD can affect people of any age: children, adolescents, adults, and the elderly. Even the elderly can develop PTSD after remembering unprocessed traumas from decades ago.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Denying the existence of PTSD in other life stages can leave children, the elderly, or at-risk adults without support, perpetuating suffering and misunderstanding.</p></details><details><summary><strong>4: Children can&#39;t have PTSD because &quot;they don&#39;t understand&quot; trauma.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Children can develop PTSD, although their symptoms may manifest differently (for example, through repetitive play or behavioral regressions).<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Denial of childhood PTSD increases the possibility of misdiagnosis and delay in effective interventions during critical developmental stages.</p></details><details><summary><strong>5: If you already had PTSD in youth, you can&#39;t have it again in adulthood.</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> A person can experience multiple episodes of PTSD throughout their life, especially if exposed to new traumatic events.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> This myth can lead to false security and lack of preparation for new episodes, making self-care and prevention of relapses difficult.</p></details><hr><blockquote><p>🔗 <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#dignidad-espiritual-y-salud-mental" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Spiritual dignity and mental health</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#naturaleza-de-la-regulaci%C3%B3n-emocional" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nature of emotional regulation</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
