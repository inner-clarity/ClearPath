However, when one spouse needs emotional regulation strategies to feel safe in their body, misunderstandings arise that can affect emotional and spiritual connection. Below, <strong>5 common myths</strong> are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.</p><details><summary><strong>1. &quot;P.R.E.N.C. is cured or not needed if you have many sexual relations per week.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Emotional regulation and sexual intimacy are distinct neurological systems. Although marital intimacy can be comforting, it doesn&#39;t replace the need for basic somatic regulation in people with PTSD-C, dissociation, or sensory hypersensitivity. The nervous system doesn&#39;t &quot;reset&quot; due to sexual frequency.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Marital intimacy is instrumentalized as &quot;treatment&quot;, generating pressure, guilt, or emotional disconnection.</p></details><details><summary><strong>2. &quot;If your spouse needs a P.R.E.N.C., it&#39;s because intimacy isn&#39;t enough.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> The need for a P.R.E.N.C. doesn&#39;t reflect a deficiency in the relationship, but a characteristic of the nervous system. A person can deeply love their spouse and fully enjoy intimacy, and still need compression clothing, a tactile object, or a symbolic garment to feel safe in their body.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Regulatory need is interpreted as personal rejection, damaging marital trust.</p></details><details><summary><strong>3. &quot;P.R.E.N.C. interfere with marital purity.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Marital purity is defined by love, mutual respect, and fidelity, not by the absence of neurological needs. Using a P.R.E.N.C. to feel present and safe can enrich intimacy, not contaminate it.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> A physiological need is moralized, generating unnecessary shame in a sacred space.</p></details><details><summary><strong>4. &quot;A healthy sexual relationship eliminates the need for &#39;external aids&#39;.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Marital health includes accepting the totality of the other, including their regulatory needs. Asking someone to abandon an essential P.R.E.N.C. to &quot;prove&quot; that the relationship is sufficient confuses love with self-sufficiency.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> A dynamic of conditionality is created: &quot;I&#39;ll love you if you stop needing support&quot;.</p></details><details><summary><strong>5. &quot;If you use diapers or special clothing, you can&#39;t have a full sexual life.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Sexual fulfillment doesn&#39;t depend on external &quot;normality&quot;, but on internal security, communication, and emotional connection. Many people with P.R.E.N.C. have deeply intimate and faithful marital lives, precisely because they feel safe in their body thanks to those strategies.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Sexual dignity is assumed to be linked to sensory conformity, unjustly excluding those who regulate in unconventional ways.</p></details><hr><blockquote><p>🔗 <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#seguridad-emocional-conyugal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Marital Emotional Security</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#dignidad-espiritual-y-salud-mental" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Spiritual dignity and mental health</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
