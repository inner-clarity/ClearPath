But when a person needs support to regulate their nervous system during these moments, myths arise that confuse physiology with faith. Below, <strong>5 common myths</strong> are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.</p><details><summary><strong>1. &quot;If you need a P.R.E.N.C. to pray with focus, your faith is weak.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Faith isn&#39;t measured by the capacity to maintain attention without support, but by the sincere desire to draw near to God. For people with PTSD-C, autism, or sensory dysregulation, a P.R.E.N.C. (like a compression garment or tactile object) reduces hypervigilance and allows the heart to focus on prayer, not on internal chaos.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Neurological physiology is confused with spiritual quality, generating guilt for legitimate needs.</p></details><details><summary><strong>2. &quot;The Spirit can&#39;t guide you if you use &#39;physical aids&#39; when studying the Scriptures.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> The Holy Spirit doesn&#39;t withdraw due to the use of tools that allow greater mental presence. On the contrary, as <em>InnerSight – Psychological Foundations</em> teaches, when the nervous system is regulated, it&#39;s more receptive to inspiration. The Savior used physical objects (mud, saliva) to heal; God honors the means that facilitate connection with Him.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> &quot;Self-sufficiency&quot; is spiritualized, excluding those who need support to access the Scriptures with peace.</p></details><details><summary><strong>3. &quot;Praying or studying with an object in hand is lack of reverence.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> For many people, touching an object with a specific texture (a bracelet, a smooth stone, underwear) is a form of somatic grounding that prevents dissociation. Without it, they could &quot;float&quot; mentally and not be present at all during prayer or study.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Self-regulation is interpreted as distraction, when in reality it&#39;s an act of active devotion to remain in the sacred moment.</p></details><details><summary><strong>4. &quot;If you can&#39;t pray in silence and stillness like others, you&#39;re not ready to receive revelation.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Revelation doesn&#39;t require a &quot;normal&quot; body, but a willing heart. As <em>InnerSight – Spiritual dignity and mental health</em> affirms, God knows the real needs of His children and communicates with them in the form they can receive. A young person with autism who gently rocks while praying may be closer to the Spirit than someone still but distracted.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> An external standard of spirituality is imposed that denies the diversity of the body of Christ.</p></details><details><summary><strong>5. &quot;Depending on a P.R.E.N.C. for personal spiritual life shows you don&#39;t trust in the Lord.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Trust in the Lord doesn&#39;t mean rejecting the resources He has allowed to exist, including neuroscience, therapy, and bodily self-regulation strategies. As <em>InnerSight – Nature of emotional regulation</em> teaches, these needs aren&#39;t whims, but legitimate adaptive responses.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> A false dichotomy is created between faith and functionality, leading faithful people to force &quot;spiritual presence&quot; from a state of alarm, which can cause exhaustion, discouragement, and distancing from God.</p></details><hr><blockquote><p>🔗 <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#naturaleza-de-la-regulaci%C3%B3n-emocional" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nature of emotional regulation</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#dignidad-espiritual-y-salud-mental" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Spiritual dignity and mental health</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
