However, outside clinical contexts, these topics often appear in sexualized environments, which generates confusion and shame. Below, <strong>5 common myths</strong> are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.</p><details><summary><strong>1. &quot;If you search for &#39;adult diapers&#39; on the Internet and see sexual content, then using them is always fetishism.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Search algorithms and social media prioritize viral or sexualized content, not clinical content. This doesn&#39;t mean that all people who use diapers have a fetish. In the context of P.R.E.N.C., their use is regulatory, not erotic.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Sexual intention is assumed where there&#39;s neurological need, generating unjust shame and preventing faithful people from seeking support.</p></details><details><summary><strong>2. &quot;If you don&#39;t find serious information on Google, it&#39;s because it&#39;s not real.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Lack of public clinical visibility doesn&#39;t deny the existence of a legitimate need. Many resources on unconventional emotional regulation are in specialized literature (neuroscience, trauma, occupational therapy), not in general searches.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Personal experience is discredited due to absence of results on the Internet, instead of seeking reliable clinical sources.</p></details><details><summary><strong>3. &quot;If on TikTok or Instagram everything related to P.R.E.N.C. seems sexual, then it can&#39;t be something spiritual or serious.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Social media amplifies the sensational, not the representative. The fact that a topic is sexualized on social media doesn&#39;t invalidate its legitimate use in mental health contexts.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> A deep need is judged by its distorted representation in non-clinical media.</p></details><details><summary><strong>4. &quot;If there are no videos of religious leaders talking about this, it must be inappropriate.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Absence of public discussion doesn&#39;t equal doctrinal condemnation. Many mental health and neurological topics are new in pastoral discourse, but not contradictory to the Gospel. As InnerSight affirms, spiritual dignity doesn&#39;t depend on the public visibility of a need.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Institutional silence is equated with moral disapproval.</p></details><details><summary><strong>5. &quot;If when searching the Internet I only see adult or fetishist content, then my desire to use a P.R.E.N.C. must be sin.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Intention defines moral nature, not the object itself. Using a diaper to feel safe while sleeping —without sexual component— is a way of caring for the temple of the Spirit, not a transgression. As InnerSight teaches, emotional regulation strategies are not related to sexual orientation nor inappropriate preferences.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Guilt is internalized for a legitimate need, which can lead to spiritual and emotional isolation.</p></details><hr><blockquote><p>🔗 <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#naturaleza-de-la-regulaci%C3%B3n-emocional" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nature of emotional regulation</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#cuando-el-amor-se-condiciona-a-la-conformidad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">When love is conditioned on conformity</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
