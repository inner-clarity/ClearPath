Each myth is debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.</p><details><summary><strong>51. &quot;In marriage, both spouses should regulate the same way.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Each person has a unique nervous system; what regulates one may not work —or even harm— the other.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> A &quot;normality&quot; standard is imposed that invalidates the legitimate needs of one spouse.</p></details><details><summary><strong>52. &quot;If your spouse needs a P.R.E.N.C., they don&#39;t love you enough.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> The need for regulation is not related to love, but to the physiology of the nervous system after trauma or neurodivergence.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Need is confused with rejection, generating emotional insecurity.</p></details><details><summary><strong>53. &quot;P.R.E.N.C. interfere with marital intimacy.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Many P.R.E.N.C. allow the person to be more present and secure, which can improve intimate connection.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Regulation is assumed to be an obstacle, when it can actually be a bridge.</p></details><details><summary><strong>54. &quot;A spouse who uses diapers can&#39;t have a mature relationship.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Symbolic use of diapers (without physiological function) can be a legitimate self-regulation strategy after abandonment trauma.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Marital maturity is judged by external standards, not by the quality of the bond.</p></details><details><summary><strong>55. &quot;If your spouse needs special clothing to sleep, something is broken in their faith.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Faith and somatic regulation coexist; one doesn&#39;t cancel the other.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> A neurological need is spiritualized, generating unnecessary guilt.</p></details><details><summary><strong>56. &quot;P.R.E.N.C. are an excuse to avoid physical intimacy.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> In many cases, P.R.E.N.C. allow the person to feel safe to participate in intimacy.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Need is interpreted as rejection, damaging marital trust.</p></details><details><summary><strong>57. &quot;A good spouse would never need &#39;external help&#39; to calm down.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Self-regulation is not always possible after complex trauma; P.R.E.N.C. are tools of autonomy, not dependence.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Self-sufficiency is idealized, ignoring the reality of neurological damage.</p></details><details><summary><strong>58. &quot;If your spouse uses regulatory objects, they don&#39;t trust you as a refuge.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> P.R.E.N.C. don&#39;t replace the spouse; they complement human support when the nervous system is on alert.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> A physiological need is taken as a personal offense.</p></details><details><summary><strong>59. &quot;In marriage, everything should be shared; private P.R.E.N.C. are dangerous secrets.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Some P.R.E.N.C. are intimate by nature (like regulatory underwear) and don&#39;t imply concealment, but personal dignity.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Privacy is confused with lack of transparency.</p></details><details><summary><strong>60. &quot;If you can&#39;t leave your P.R.E.N.C. for your spouse, you&#39;re not willing to sacrifice.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Asking someone to abandon an essential regulatory strategy is not an act of love, but a demand that can cause emotional collapse.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> The concept of sacrifice is distorted, turning it into coercion.</p></details><hr><blockquote><p>🔗 <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#seguridad-emocional-conyugal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Marital Emotional Security</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#dignidad-espiritual-y-salud-mental" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Spiritual dignity and mental health</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
