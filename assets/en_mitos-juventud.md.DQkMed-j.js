When young people with emotional regulation needs —due to trauma, neurodivergence, or anxiety— use unconventional strategies, misunderstandings arise that can affect their faith, self-esteem, and belonging. Below, <strong>5 common myths</strong> are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.</p><details><summary><strong>1. &quot;If an adolescent needs a P.R.E.N.C., it&#39;s because they haven&#39;t matured emotionally.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> The need for a P.R.E.N.C. doesn&#39;t reflect immaturity, but a neurological response to trauma, neurodivergence, or sensory dysregulation. Many adolescents with PTSD-C or autism use regulatory strategies not because they &quot;refuse to grow&quot;, but because their nervous system hasn&#39;t yet developed other safe self-regulation pathways.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> A legitimate need is pathologized as &quot;lack of effort&quot;, damaging the young person&#39;s self-esteem and faith.</p></details><details><summary><strong>2. &quot;Young people who use P.R.E.N.C. will never be able to serve as missionaries or have important callings.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> The capacity to serve doesn&#39;t depend on the absence of regulatory needs, but on faith, willingness, and adequate support. Many young people with P.R.E.N.C. have served missions, led quorums, and participated fully in the Church thanks to being allowed to regulate with dignity (<em>InnerSight – Institutional Proposal</em>).<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Spiritual doors are closed prematurely, limiting the young person&#39;s potential and contradicting Doctrine and Covenants 82:19: &quot;And it shall be given to every man according to his needs&quot;.</p></details><details><summary><strong>3. &quot;It&#39;s the parents&#39; fault for allowing the use of P.R.E.N.C. in adolescence.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Supporting a child in their regulatory needs is not indulgence, but informed and compassionate parenting. As <em>InnerSight – Guide for Difficult Family Conversations</em> teaches, parents who validate their children&#39;s needs strengthen their resilience and faith, not their dependence.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Faithful families are unjustly blamed, generating isolation and shame instead of community support.</p></details><details><summary><strong>4. &quot;If a young person uses a P.R.E.N.C., their peers will think they&#39;re &#39;weird&#39; and won&#39;t accept them.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Exclusion doesn&#39;t arise from the P.R.E.N.C., but from lack of education and empathy in the environment. When leaders and peers understand that these strategies are legitimate forms of self-regulation (<em>InnerSight – Psychological Foundations</em>), young people are more accepted, not less.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> &quot;Social normality&quot; is prioritized over Christian inclusion, teaching young people that they must hide their needs to be loved.</p></details><details><summary><strong>5. &quot;Adolescence is the stage to &#39;overcome&#39; these needs; if they don&#39;t, something is wrong.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Neurological development doesn&#39;t follow a uniform schedule. Some people need regulatory strategies for years, others for life —and that doesn&#39;t indicate spiritual or personal failure. As <em>InnerSight – Spiritual dignity and mental health</em> affirms, holiness isn&#39;t measured by conformity, but by the heart.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> An unrealistic expectation is imposed that generates anxiety, self-criticism, and distancing from the Church.</p></details><hr><blockquote><p>🔗 <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#gu%C3%ADa-para-conversaciones-familiares-dif%C3%ADciles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Guide for Difficult Family Conversations</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#psychological-foundations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Psychological Foundations</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
