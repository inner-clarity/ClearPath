However, these strategies are often misinterpreted as &quot;lack of faith&quot; or &quot;unnecessary dependence&quot;. Below, <strong>5 common myths</strong> about the use of technology as a legitimate form of emotional regulation are debunked.</p><details><summary><strong>1. &quot;Depending on an app, watch, or device to calm down is spiritual laziness.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Regulatory technology (like guided breathing apps, watches with tactile feedback, or soft stimulation devices) doesn&#39;t replace faith, but complements it, by allowing the nervous system to be in a state where it can receive the Spirit. As <em>InnerSight</em> teaches, emotional regulation is a neurological need, not a spiritual preference.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> The use of legitimate tools is moralized, generating guilt for seeking support in means that God has allowed to exist.</p></details><details><summary><strong>2. &quot;Faith should be enough; you don&#39;t need devices to feel peace.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Faith and neuroscience are not mutually exclusive. The Savior used mud, saliva, and physical objects to heal (John 9:6); God honors the means that allow His children to access Him. A device that reduces hypervigilance doesn&#39;t diminish faith; it makes it possible in a wounded body.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Self-sufficiency is confused with holiness, contradicting the principle that we all need grace and support.</p></details><details><summary><strong>3. &quot;If you use technology to regulate your emotions, you&#39;re not trusting in the Lord.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Trust in the Lord doesn&#39;t mean rejecting the resources He has made available, including science, medicine, and technology. As <em>InnerSight – Spiritual dignity and mental health</em> affirms, &quot;God knows the real needs of His children&quot; and doesn&#39;t demand that they ignore their physiology to demonstrate faith.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> A false dichotomy is created between faith and functionality, distancing faithful members from tools that would allow them to serve and belong fully.</p></details><details><summary><strong>4. &quot;Regulatory devices are only for people with a medical diagnosis.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Many people don&#39;t have access to formal diagnosis, but their regulatory needs are equally real. The effectiveness of a device doesn&#39;t depend on clinical status, but on whether it restores the capacity to be present, pray, relate, and serve (<em>InnerSight – Purpose</em>).<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Support is conditioned on institutional validation, excluding those who struggle in silence without resources for professional evaluation.</p></details><details><summary><strong>5. &quot;Using technology for emotional regulation is a form of evasion, not spiritual growth.&quot;</strong></summary><p><strong>Reality:</strong> Emotional regulation isn&#39;t evasion, but preparation. Without a regulated nervous system, it&#39;s difficult to hear the Spirit, study the Scriptures with focus, or participate in Church life. As <em>InnerSight – Psychological Foundations</em> explains, these devices create the conditions for spiritual growth, not prevent it.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> An essential self-regulation strategy is discredited, leading the person to force &quot;spiritual presence&quot; from a state of alarm, which can cause exhaustion and distancing.</p></details><hr><blockquote><p>🔗 <strong>Related in InnerSight</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#comprensi%C3%B3n-cl%C3%ADnica-de-las-necesidades-de-regulaci%C3%B3n-emocional" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Clinical understanding of emotional regulation needs</a></li><li><a href="https://inner-clarity.github.io/InnerSight/en#psychological-foundations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Psychological Foundations</a></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>ClearPath is an independent educational resource.
