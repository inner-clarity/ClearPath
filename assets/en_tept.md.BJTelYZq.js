It is not a sign of spiritual weakness, lack of faith, or disobedience. It is a <strong>comprehensible neurological response</strong> to an experience that exceeds the nervous system&#39;s capacity to process it at the time.</p><hr><h2 id="what-distinguishes-it-from-a-normal-stress-reaction" tabindex="-1">What distinguishes it from a normal stress reaction? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-distinguishes-it-from-a-normal-stress-reaction" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What distinguishes it from a normal stress reaction?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>It&#39;s normal to feel fear, confusion, or restlessness after a dangerous event. The body activates its &quot;alarm&quot; system (fight, flight, immobility, or collapse) as a survival mechanism.<br> In PTSD, <strong>that system doesn&#39;t return to calm</strong>. Symptoms persist beyond a month and interfere with daily life, relationships, and perception of self and the world.</p><hr><h2 id="essential-diagnostic-criteria-dsm-5" tabindex="-1">Essential diagnostic criteria (DSM-5) <a class="header-anchor" href="#essential-diagnostic-criteria-dsm-5" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Essential diagnostic criteria (DSM-5)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>For PTSD to be considered, <strong>all</strong> of the following symptom groups must be present for <strong>more than a month</strong>:</p><h3 id="_1-re-experiencing" tabindex="-1">1. <strong>Re-experiencing</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-re-experiencing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1. **Re-experiencing**&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><em>Flashbacks</em>: feeling of reliving the trauma as if it were happening again.</li><li>Recurrent nightmares related to the event.</li><li>Intense distress when encountering reminders (sounds, smells, dates, places).</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Example</strong>: A person who suffered a car accident feels panic when hearing brake sounds or getting into a car.</p></blockquote><h3 id="_2-avoidance" tabindex="-1">2. <strong>Avoidance</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-avoidance" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2. **Avoidance**&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li>Avoiding thoughts, emotions, or conversations about the trauma.</li><li>Avoiding people, places, or activities that remind of the event.</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Example</strong>: Someone who was assaulted in a night park no longer leaves home after dark.</p></blockquote><h3 id="_3-cognitive-and-mood-alterations" tabindex="-1">3. <strong>Cognitive and mood alterations</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-cognitive-and-mood-alterations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3. **Cognitive and mood alterations**&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li>Persistent negative beliefs (&quot;I&#39;m guilty&quot;, &quot;No one can be trusted&quot;, &quot;The world is completely dangerous&quot;).</li><li>Dissociative amnesia (not remembering important parts of the trauma).</li><li>Loss of interest in meaningful activities.</li><li>Persistent feelings of fear, guilt, shame, or emotional emptiness.</li></ul><h3 id="_4-arousal-and-reactivity-alterations" tabindex="-1">4. <strong>Arousal and reactivity alterations</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-arousal-and-reactivity-alterations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;4. **Arousal and reactivity alterations**&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li>Irritability or anger outbursts.</li><li>Hypervigilance (being constantly &quot;on alert&quot;).</li><li>Being easily startled.</li><li>Difficulty sleeping or concentrating.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="ptsd-vs-complex-ptsd-c-ptsd" tabindex="-1">PTSD vs. Complex PTSD (C-PTSD) <a class="header-anchor" href="#ptsd-vs-complex-ptsd-c-ptsd" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;PTSD vs. Complex PTSD (C-PTSD)&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="classic-ptsd" tabindex="-1">Classic PTSD <a class="header-anchor" href="#classic-ptsd" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Classic PTSD&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li>Arises after <strong>a single traumatic event or limited in time</strong> (e.g., natural disaster, accident, assault).</li><li>Symptoms focus on reaction to the specific event.</li></ul><h3 id="complex-ptsd-c-ptsd" tabindex="-1">Complex PTSD (C-PTSD) <a class="header-anchor" href="#complex-ptsd-c-ptsd" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Complex PTSD (C-PTSD)&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li>Arises from <strong>prolonged or repeated interpersonal trauma</strong>, especially in contexts where <strong>there is no real possibility of escape</strong> (e.g., childhood abuse, chronic neglect, prolonged abusive relationships, captivity).</li><li>Includes <strong>additional symptoms</strong>: <ul><li>Extreme difficulty regulating emotions (emotional storms or affective anesthesia).</li><li>Fragmented or negative sense of identity (&quot;I don&#39;t know who I am&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m broken&quot;).</li><li>Chaotic relational patterns (extreme fear of abandonment, idealization followed by rejection).</li><li>Deep distrust in others or in life itself.</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Comparative example</strong>:</p><ul><li><em>Classic PTSD</em>: A firefighter who rescued victims from a fire and now has nightmares when smelling smoke.</li><li><em>C-PTSD</em>: A person who grew up in a home with constant emotional violence and now, in their adult relationships, freezes at any disagreement, feels they &quot;don&#39;t deserve love&quot; and avoids intimacy for fear of being betrayed.</li></ul></blockquote><hr><h2 id="neurological-basis-why-it-s-not-lack-of-faith" tabindex="-1">Neurological basis: Why it&#39;s not &quot;lack of faith&quot;?
