# Myths about P.R.E.N.C. and sacramental life

The sacrament meeting is a sacred time of covenant renewal. However, when a person needs emotional regulation strategies to be present in that moment, misunderstandings arise. Below are **5 common myths** debunked â€”with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.

<details>
<summary><strong>1. "If you need a P.R.E.N.C. to be in sacrament meeting, you're not being reverent."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Reverence isn't measured by physical stillness, but by the intention of the heart. A person who uses compression clothing, a tactile object, or a regulatory garment does so to be present, not to distract themselves. As <em>InnerSight</em> teaches, emotional regulation allows greater connection with the Spirit, not less.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> External expression is confused with internal devotion, excluding those who need support to participate fully.</p>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. "You can't take the sacrament if you use a P.R.E.N.C. because you're not in a worthy state."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Worthiness to take the sacrament doesn't depend on the absence of neurological needs, but on repentance, faith in Christ, and desire to renew covenants (<em>InnerSight â€“ Spiritual dignity and mental health</em>). A P.R.E.N.C. can be precisely what allows a person to focus on the meaning of the sacrament, not on their anxiety.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> A non-doctrinal barrier is imposed on access to a central ordinance, generating unnecessary guilt.</p>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. "If you move, touch an object, or use special clothing during the sacrament, you're being disrespectful."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Many regulatory movements or gestures (like rubbing a bracelet, adjusting a garment, or rocking gently) are non-verbal strategies to avoid dissociation. Without them, the person could "disconnect" completely and not be present at all.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Self-regulation is interpreted as distraction, when it's actually an effort to remain in the sacred moment.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4. "The Spirit can't be with you if you depend on an object during the sacrament."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> The Holy Spirit doesn't withdraw due to physiological needs, but due to conscious moral decisions. The Savior used mud, saliva, and physical objects to heal (John 9:6); God honors the means that allow His children to access Him.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> "Self-sufficiency" is spiritualized, contradicting the principle that we all need grace, support, and means of grace.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>5. "If you can't sit still like others, you shouldn't attend sacrament meeting."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Belonging isn't earned by conformity. <em>InnerSight</em> teaches that ministering with Christ-like love includes creating spaces where everyone can participate, even if they do so in unconventional ways. The presence of a person who regulates with dignity enriches the community, doesn't disturb it.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> The comfort of the majority is prioritized over the inclusion of the wounded, contradicting the Good Shepherd's example.</p>
