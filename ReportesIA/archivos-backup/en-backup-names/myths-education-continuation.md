# Myths about P.R.E.N.C. and Education (Cont.)

In Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), P.R.E.N.C. can have an impact on aspects of life, when in reality it can influence, but in ways that are often misinterpreted. These myths address erroneous beliefs that teachers, administrators, peers or even students themselves may have about the use of unconventional emotional strategies in learning contexts. Below, **5 common myths** are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.

<details>
<summary><strong>1: PRENCs are only for students with clinical diagnosis.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Any student can benefit from emotional regulation strategies, especially in high-pressure contexts (exams, presentations, bullying). Normalizing PRENCs for everyone â€”not just for those with diagnosisâ€” reduces stigma and strengthens collective mental health.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2: If a student needs PRENC, they should be in a different type of school.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Educational inclusion is based on the idea that **all schools must adapt to human diversity**, not the other way around. Using PRENCs demonstrates that the student is trying to participate in the current environment, not that they "don't belong" to it.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3: PRENCs interfere with the development of school "resilience".</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> True resilience is not enduring discomfort in silence, but **learning to navigate it with effective tools**. PRENCs teach students to recognize their limits and act with self-awareness, a vital skill for academic and personal life.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4: University students "should already overcome" the need for PRENCs.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> PTSD, anxiety or post-traumatic stress don't disappear with age. Many university students face recent (violence, migration, loss) or untreated traumas. PRENCs allow them to remain in their studies, avoiding dropout due to unregulated emotional crises.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>5: Integrating PRENCs in the classroom is "lowering the academic level".</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Quite the opposite: a regulated brain **learns better**. When students feel safe and can self-regulate, they improve their attention, memory and participation. PRENCs don't subtract academic rigor; they make it accessible to more people.
