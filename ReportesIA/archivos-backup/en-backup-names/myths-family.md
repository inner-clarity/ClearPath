# Myths about P.R.E.N.C. and family 

In Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), P.R.E.N.C. can have an impact on aspects of life, when in reality it can influence, but in ways that are often misinterpreted. These myths explore deep-rooted â€”but erroneousâ€” beliefs about how unconventional emotional strategies interact with family bonds, whether in childhood, adulthood or in families with trauma histories. Below, **5 common myths** are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.

<details>
<summary><strong>1: If you use PRENC at home, it's because your family "doesn't take good care of you".</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Using PRENC does not indicate family failure, but emotional self-responsibility. Even in loving families, people with PTSD or other sensitivities need personal tools to regulate their nervous system, something that love alone cannot do.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2: Parents should be the only emotional regulators of their children; PRENCs are not needed.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Although parental co-regulation is fundamental in childhood, teaching children self-regulation strategies (like a "sensory corner" or a security object) gives them emotional autonomy. PRENCs, adapted to their age, are empowerment tools, not substitutes for attachment.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3: If an adult uses PRENC in front of their family, they are "excluding" them or "hiding their emotions".</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Using a PRENC (like breathing deeply or touching a calming stone) can be a way to **avoid impulsive reactions** that damage family communication. It's not hiding, but an effort to respond from calm, not from trauma.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4: In a "good family", everyone regulates together; there's no place for individual practices like PRENCs.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Healthy families balance collective support with respect for individual needs. Some members may need moments or personal tools to feel safe. This doesn't break unity; it strengthens it with differentiated empathy.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>5: PRENCs are "excuses" not to participate in family life.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> On the contrary, many use PRENCs precisely **to be able to participate**: a person with sensory hypersensitivity can use headphones with calming sounds during a noisy family dinner, allowing them to stay present instead of withdrawing from overwhelm.
