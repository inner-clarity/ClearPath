# Myths about P.R.E.N.C. and friendship (cont.)

In Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), P.R.E.N.C. can have an impact on aspects of life, when in reality it can influence, but in ways that are often misinterpreted. These myths explore erroneous beliefs about how the use of unconventional emotional strategies impacts (or doesn't) friendship relationships. However, when a person needs emotional regulation strategies to inhabit their body with peace, myths arise that confuse physiology in friendship bonds. Below, **5 common myths** are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.

<details>
<summary><strong>1: "Normal" friendships don't include rituals or unconventional emotional practices.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Many friendships develop their own healing rituals: walking in silence, writing emotional letters, watching the sunset together or even creating a "safety code" for crisis moments. These are shared PRENCs, and they strengthen the bond.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2: If a friend doesn't accept your PRENC, they're not a true friend.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Friendship doesn't require total approval, but basic respect. Some friends may not understand your PRENC, but they can respect your space. Judging their "true friendship" only by this can be unfair; education and dialogue are key.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3: Using PRENC in groups (like in meetings) is antisocial or selfish.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Discreetly integrating a PRENC (like using a sensory ring or practicing mindfulness for a few seconds) can be a form of social self-care: it allows you to stay in the group without disconnecting from overstimulation or anxiety.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4: PRENCs are only for crisis moments, they have no place in shared joy with friends.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Some PRENCs are also used to **amplify joy** or connection: dancing freely together, creating spontaneous art, or sharing a "gratitude mantra". Emotional regulation is not just for pain, but for fully living any emotion.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>5: If you use PRENC, your friends will think you're "broken" or "too sensitive".</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> That perception says more about others' prejudices than about you. More and more people value emotional intelligence and self-regulation as signs of strength. Sharing your PRENCs with close friends can even inspire them to explore their own tools.
