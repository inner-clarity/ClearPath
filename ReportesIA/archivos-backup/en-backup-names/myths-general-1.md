These are the first 10 of a collection of **70 fundamental myths** that address common confusions about Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD/PTSD-C) and Non-Conventional Emotional Regulation Procedures (P.R.E.N.C.). Each myth is debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.

<details>
<summary><strong>1. "PTSD is only for soldiers or war victims."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> PTSD can arise after any traumatic event (abuse, neglect, accidents, domestic violence).<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Invisibilizes the suffering of civilians, especially women and children.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. "If you don't remember the trauma, you can't have PTSD."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Dissociative amnesia is a common symptom of PTSD-C. The body remembers even if the mind doesn't.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Support is denied to those who don't have "narrative evidence".</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. "PTSD is cured with more faith or prayer."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Trauma alters brain circuits; faith can accompany, but doesn't substitute neurological regulation.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Blames the person for "not praying enough".</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4. "People with PTSD are dangerous or violent."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Most people freeze or withdraw; aggression is rare and usually defensive.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Stigmatization and social exclusion.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>5. "If you function well at work, you can't have PTSD."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Many people "function" with high emotional cost (exhaustion, dissociation).<br><strong>Risk:</strong> The severity of internal suffering is denied.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>6. "PTSD-C is not a real diagnosis."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Although it's not in the DSM-5 (USA), it is in the ICD-11 (WHO) and is widely recognized clinically.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> The experience of those who suffered prolonged trauma is invalidated.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>7. "Childhood trauma doesn't matter if 'it's already over'."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Early trauma reconfigures the developing brain. Its effects are lasting without intervention.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> The impact of childhood helplessness is minimized.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>8. "Nightmares or flashbacks are 'just in the head'."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> They are real physiological responses, with activation of the autonomic nervous system.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> The sensory experience of trauma is discredited.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>9. "If you don't cry or look sad, you're not traumatized."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Affective anesthesia is a common symptom of PTSD.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Disconnection is confused with indifference.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>10. "PTSD disappears with time."</strong></summary>
