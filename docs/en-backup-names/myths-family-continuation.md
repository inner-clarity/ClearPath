# Myths about P.R.E.N.C. and family (Cont.)

In Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), P.R.E.N.C. can have an impact on aspects of life, when in reality it can influence, but in ways that are often misinterpreted. These myths explore deep-rooted â€”but erroneousâ€” beliefs about how unconventional emotional strategies interact with family bonds, whether in childhood, adulthood or in families with trauma histories. Below, **5 common myths** are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.

<details>
<summary><strong>1: If your family doesn't understand your PRENC, it's because they don't accept you as you are.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Lack of understanding is not always rejection. Many families simply haven't been exposed to unconventional emotional regulation approaches. With patience and simple explanation ("this helps me calm down, like walking helps you"), they can come to respect it, even if they don't share it.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2: PRENCs are unnecessary if the family already does therapy or talks about emotions.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Therapy and communication are essential, but not always accessible at the exact moment of an emotional crisis. PRENCs act as "bridges" between sessions or conversations, offering immediate relief and preventing conflict escalation at home.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3: In families with intergenerational trauma, PRENCs "ignore the real problem".</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> PRENCs don't replace deep family trauma work, but they do **create safe conditions** to address it. A regulated person is more capable of facing difficult conversations without collapsing or attacking. They are a preliminary step, not an evasion.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4: Children shouldn't use PRENCs because they will "copy strange behaviors".</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> When presented naturally and purposefully ("this helps me calm down, do you want to try something that helps you?"), PRENCs teach children **practical emotional intelligence**. Many develop their own versions: hugging a blanket, drawing their emotions or counting to ten with their fingers.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>5: Family love should be enough to "cure" any discomfort; PRENCs are a distraction.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Love is powerful, but it's not a neurological treatment. Trauma alters the brain and body, and requires specific regulation strategies. PRENCs, used within the context of family love, **enhance healing**, they don't obstruct it.
