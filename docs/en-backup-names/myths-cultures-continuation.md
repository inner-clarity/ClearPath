# About P.R.E.N.C. and cultures (continuation)

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is not limited to one culture. It can arise in any geographic context, even decades after trauma, and can affect people of all ages and contexts. However, when a person needs emotional regulation strategies to inhabit their body with peace, myths arise that confuse physiology with cultural aspects. Below, **5 common myths** are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.

<details>
<summary><strong>1: In cultures with strong spiritual beliefs, trauma is "cured with faith", not with psychology.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Faith and spiritual practices can be valuable resources, but they don't substitute clinical treatment when there's a disorder like PTSD. Many people in religious or spiritual cultures also benefit from psychological therapies adapted to their values.<br>
<strong>Risk:</strong> This myth can lead to delaying or avoiding necessary treatments, worsening symptoms and perpetuating suffering.

<summary><strong>2: Indigenous peoples don't suffer PTSD because they live "in harmony with nature".</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> This romantic idea ignores the history of violence, displacement, colonization and abuse that many indigenous peoples have suffered. Studies show high rates of PTSD in indigenous communities affected by historical and contemporary traumas.<br>
<strong>Risk:</strong> This idealization can lead to invisibilization of historical and contemporary trauma in indigenous communities, denying access to mental health services.

<summary><strong>3: In countries at war, trauma is "normal", so there's no PTSD.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Prolonged exposure to trauma doesn't make it "normal" or harmless. In contexts of armed conflict, disasters or structural violence, PTSD rates are usually significantly higher than in unexposed populations.<br>
<strong>Risk:</strong> This normalization of trauma can lead to lack of early intervention and perpetuation of the cycle of violence and suffering.

<details>
<summary><strong>4: People from Asian cultures don't report PTSD because they "keep emotions inside".</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Although some Asian cultures value emotional containment, this doesn't mean absence of suffering. PTSD can manifest with physical symptoms (pain, fatigue) or through culturally accepted expressions, but it's still present and requires attention.<br>
<strong>Risk:</strong> This stereotype can lead to erroneous or delayed diagnoses, as symptoms may manifest differently from Western expectations.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>5: PTSD is not diagnosed the same in all cultures, therefore it's not real everywhere.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> PTSD expression may vary culturally, but its core â€”an intense and persistent psychological response to a traumatic eventâ€” is universal. Mental health professionals are trained to adapt diagnosis and treatment to the patient's cultural context.<br>
<strong>Risk:</strong> This myth can lead to lack of PTSD recognition in specific cultural contexts, perpetuating suffering and lack of access to appropriate treatments.
