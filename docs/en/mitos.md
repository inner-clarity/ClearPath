## Myths about PRENC in marriage

<details>
<summary><strong>51. "In marriage, both spouses should regulate the same way."</strong></summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>52. "If your spouse needs a P.R.E.N.C., they don't love you enough."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> The need for regulation is not related to love, but to nervous system physiology after trauma or neurodivergence.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Need is confused with rejection, generating emotional insecurity.</p>
</details>

<details>

</details>

<details>

<p><strong>Reality:</strong> In many cases, P.R.E.N.C. allow the person to feel safe to participate in intimacy.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Need is interpreted as rejection, damaging marital trust.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>57. "A good spouse would never need 'external help' to calm down."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Self-regulation isn't always possible after complex trauma; P.R.E.N.C. are autonomy tools, not dependency.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Self-sufficiency is idealized, ignoring the reality of neurological damage.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>58. "If your spouse uses regulation objects, they don't trust you as a refuge."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> P.R.E.N.C. don't replace the spouse; they complement human support when the nervous system is in alarm.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> A physiological need is taken as personal offense.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>59. "In marriage, everything should be shared; private P.R.E.N.C. are dangerous secrets."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Some P.R.E.N.C. are intimate by nature (like regulatory underwear) and don't imply concealment, but personal dignity.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Privacy is confused with lack of transparency.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>60. "If you can't leave your P.R.E.N.C. for your spouse, you're not willing to sacrifice."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Asking someone to abandon an essential regulatory strategy is not an act of love, but a demand that can cause emotional collapse.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> The concept of sacrifice is distorted, turning it into coercion.</p>
</details>

## Myths about PRENC in the family

<details>
<summary><strong>61. "It's outrageous for children to see one of their parents using diapers."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> If explained with simplicity and dignity ("this helps me calm down, like you like your blanket"), children learn empathy, neurological diversity, and respect for others' needs.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Unnecessary shame is transmitted and an opportunity to teach compassion is hidden.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>62. "If your daughter sees you using diapers, she'll be traumatized."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Children don't get "traumatized" by seeing human needs regulated calmly; they get traumatized by fear, violence, or emotional incoherence.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Adult stigma is projected onto childhood innocence.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>63. "A father who uses P.R.E.N.C. is not a role model."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Modeling self-regulation, self-care, and emotional honesty is one of the best lessons a father can give.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> "Normality" is confused with moral integrity.</p>

<details>
<summary><strong>64. "Children will think it's wrong not to use diapers if they see their dad with one."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Children understand contextual differences ("this is for dad, you don't need it"). Confusion only arises if presented with shame or secrecy.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Children's capacity to understand functional diversity is underestimated.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>65. "It's selfish to use P.R.E.N.C. at home because it affects the children."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> An emotionally regulated father is more present, patient, and available for their children. Taking care of yourself isn't selfishness, it's parental responsibility.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> The caregiver is blamed for prioritizing their stability, which can lead to exhaustion.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>66. "Grandparents or visitors will think badly of the family if they see a P.R.E.N.C. in use."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Others' perception shouldn't dictate the internal health of the home. A family that cares for itself with dignity teaches more than one that pretends perfection.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Social appearance is prioritized over real well-being.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>67. "If children see their mother needs 'help to calm down', they'll lose respect for her."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Children respect authenticity, not invulnerability. Seeing a parent handle their emotions with healthy tools fosters security.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> The myth of the "perfect parent" who never needs support is perpetuated.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>68. "P.R.E.N.C. at home confuse children about what's 'normal'."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Real life includes diversity. Children who grow up in inclusive homes develop greater empathy, cognitive flexibility, and resilience.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> An illusion of normality that doesn't exist outside the home is protected.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>69. "It's better to hide P.R.E.N.C. so as not to worry the children."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Secrecy generates anxiety; calm transparency generates security. Children perceive stress even when nothing is said to them.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> A non-verbal tension environment is created that children internalize as guilt or danger.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>70. "A home with P.R.E.N.C. is not an appropriate environment to raise faithful children."</strong></summary>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> A home where the Gospel is lived with authenticity —including compassion for one's own needs— is a seedbed of genuine faith.<br><strong>Risk:</strong> Holiness is equated with the absence of human needs, contradicting Christ's example, who healed bodies and souls.</p>
