# Myths about P.R.E.N.C. and Education

In Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), P.R.E.N.C. can have an impact on aspects of life, when in reality it can influence, but in ways that are often misinterpreted. These myths address erroneous beliefs that teachers, administrators, peers or even students themselves may have about the use of unconventional emotional strategies in learning contexts. Below, **5 common myths** are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.

<details>
<summary><strong>1: If a student needs PRENC in class, it's because they "don't try hard enough".</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Effort doesn't regulate the nervous system. Students with PTSD, ADHD, anxiety or trauma may be putting all their effort and still need tools like a sensory object or breathing pause to maintain regulation and be able to learn.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2: PRENCs distract the rest of the group and break classroom order.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Most PRENCs are discreet (like using a textured bracelet, drawing in a notebook or practicing diaphragmatic breathing). When normalized as part of an inclusive classroom, instead of distracting, they model self-regulation and empathy for all students.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3: In school, only "scientific" methods should be taught; PRENCs have no place here.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Many PRENCs are based on principles supported by neuroscience (like tactile stimulation to calm the amygdala or rhythmic movement to regulate the nervous system). Additionally, inclusive education values diversity of needs, not just uniformity of methods.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4: If a student uses PRENC, they're avoiding schoolwork.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Using a PRENC is usually a strategy to **be able to face the work**, not avoid it. For example, a student with dissociation can use a transitional object to "return to the present" and thus be able to continue with an activity.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>5: Teachers shouldn't allow PRENCs because they "create unfair privileges".</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Allowing PRENCs is a **reasonable accommodation**, not a privilege. Just as a student with myopia is allowed to use glasses, one with hypersensitivity can be allowed to use headphones or have a regulation corner. Equity isn't treating everyone the same, but giving each person what they need to participate.
