# Autism (Autism Spectrum Disorder)

## Clinical definition
**Autism**, or **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)**, is a **neurodevelopmental neurological condition** that manifests from early childhood and is characterized by differences in:
- **Social communication** (verbal and non-verbal),  
- **Interpersonal interaction patterns**,  
- The presence of **restricted interests and repetitive behaviors**,  
- And a **distinct way of processing sensory information**.

Autism **is not a disease**, nor an emotional disorder, nor the result of parenting. It is a **natural variation in human neurological architecture**, with a solid genetic basis and observable differences in brain connectivity.

## Why "spectrum"?
It's called "spectrum" because **no two autistic people are alike**. Some speak fluently; others communicate through gestures, writing, or devices. Some live independently; others need constant support. What unites them all is a **distinct way of experiencing the world**, not a deficit of humanity.

> **Important**: Autism is a **neurological identity**, not just a clinical diagnosis. Many autistic people prefer to be called "autistic people" (not "with autism"), because autism is an inseparable part of who they are.

## Essential characteristics (DSM-5)

### 1. **Persistent difficulties in social communication and interaction**
- Difficulty initiating or maintaining reciprocal conversations.  
- Atypical use of non-verbal language (eye contact, gestures, facial expression).  
- Difficulty developing relationships appropriate to developmental level (e.g., making friends, sharing interests).

> **Example**: An autistic child may not respond when called, not because they're ignoring, but because their brain processes sounds differently and needs more time to integrate auditory information.

### 2. **Restrictive and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities**
- Stereotyped movements (rocking, hand flapping, jumping).  
- Insistence on sameness (rigid routines, distress at small changes).  
- Intense and highly focused interests (e.g., trains, maps, historical dates).  
- Sensory hypersensitivity or hyposensitivity (to sounds, lights, textures, smells).

> **Example**: A young autistic woman may cover her ears during sacrament meetings not out of "lack of reverence," but because the organ echo or multiple voices cause her real sensory pain.

## Neurological basis
Neuroimaging studies show that autistic people have:
- **Different brain connectivity**: greater local connectivity (within regions) and less global connectivity (between distant regions).  
- **Atypical sensory processing**: the brain doesn't automatically filter irrelevant stimuli, which can lead to sensory overload.  
- **Differences in theory of mind**: not necessarily "lack of empathy," but difficulty inferring unexpressed intentions.

This means that **autism doesn't "heal" with discipline, prayer, or willpower**. It's a way of being, not an error to be corrected.

## Emotional regulation and non-conventional strategies
Many autistic people develop **non-conventional self-regulation strategies** to handle sensory overload or social anxiety. These may include:
- **Repetitive stimulation (stimming)**: rocking, flapping, repeating phrases, touching textures.  
- **Use of safety objects**: blankets, sensory toys, pressure clothing.  
- **Avoiding certain environments**: crowds, fluorescent lights, unpredictable noises.

These behaviors **are not "bad habits"**, but **neurological survival mechanisms**. Asking them to stop without offering alternatives can cause deep distress.

## Illustrative examples

### ✦ In childhood
A child doesn't make eye contact when speaking, but listens attentively and responds accurately. Their teachers think they're "not paying attention," but they're actually avoiding visual overload to be able to process language.

### ✦ In adolescence
A young autistic woman refuses to wear certain church clothing because the tag causes her constant physical pain. It's not rebellion: it's a legitimate sensory response.

### ✦ In adult life
An autistic man faithfully participates in his callings, but needs to briefly leave the sacrament meeting to self-regulate. This doesn't diminish his devotion; on the contrary, it allows him to return with greater presence.

## Relationship with faith and Church participation
Autistic people:
- Can have **deep, reflective, and authentic faith**.  
- Can serve in callings, attend the temple, and participate fully in Church life.  
- May need **reasonable accommodations**: predictable schedules, clear instructions, sensory-friendly environments.

Ministering with Christ-like love means **not demanding they "act like everyone else"**, but creating spaces where they can **be themselves and feel included**.

---

## Is it compatible with Gospel principles?
Absolutely. The Scriptures teach that **God knows each of His children by name** (Isaiah 43:1) and that **"he is no respecter of persons"** (Acts 10:34). The Family Proclamation affirms that **all human beings are spirit children of God**, without exception.

The spiritual dignity of an autistic person **doesn't depend on their ability to fit social norms**, but on their desire to follow Christ, their faith, and their repentance.

## What autism is NOT?
- ❌ It's not caused by vaccines, bad parenting, or lack of love.  
- ❌ It doesn't imply lack of intelligence (IQ varies as in the general population).  
- ❌ It's not incompatible with empathy, spirituality, or service.  
- ❌ It's not a "behavioral disorder" that's corrected with discipline.
