# Myths about P.R.E.N.C. and their evolution (Cont.)

In Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), P.R.E.N.C. can have an impact on aspects of life, a belief that often arises from fear of the unknown, excessive medicalization or stigma towards non-traditional self-care strategies. Below, **5 common myths** are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.

<details>
<summary><strong>1: Over time, PRENCs become ineffective and the person needs "something more extreme".</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> The effectiveness of a PRENC can vary over time, like any tool. But that doesn't mean it "evolves into something worse"; it simply indicates the need to adjust the strategy, something normal in any emotional growth process.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2: Using PRENC fosters emotional avoidance, which leads to future collapse.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Well-applied PRENCs don't avoid emotions, but help to <em>regulate intensity</em> to be able to process them without collapsing. Avoiding pain is different from modulating it. Conscious regulation is a preliminary step to processing, not an escape.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3: If a child uses PRENC, they will develop emotional dependency on objects or rituals.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Children use transitional objects naturally (stuffed animals, blankets). PRENCs adapted to their age foster self-regulation and internal security. With support, these are internalized over time, not chronified as pathological dependencies.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4: PRENCs can "activate" repressed traumatic memories and cause a crisis.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Some sensory PRENCs (like certain smells or sounds) could act as triggers, but that's not the PRENC's fault itself, but the nature of trauma. That's why it's key to choose PRENCs with self-awareness or professional guidance. Most are designed precisely to <em>prevent</em> re-experiencing, not provoke it.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>5: If something works "too well", there must be a hidden risk.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> This belief reflects a cultural bias against accessible emotional relief. Not everything simple is dangerous. Many PRENCs work because they align with basic human needs: security, sensory connection, rhythm, symbolism. Their effectiveness doesn't imply trap or hidden consequence.
