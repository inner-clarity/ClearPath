# Myths about P.R.E.N.C. and friendship 

In Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), P.R.E.N.C. can have an impact on aspects of life, when in reality it can influence, but in ways that are often misinterpreted. These myths explore erroneous beliefs about how the use of unconventional emotional strategies impacts (or doesn't) friendship relationships. However, when a person needs emotional regulation strategies to inhabit their body with peace, myths arise that confuse physiology in friendship bonds. Below, **5 common myths** are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.

<details>
<summary><strong>1: If you use PRENC, it's because your friends "don't understand you enough".</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> PRENC does not substitute friendship, but complements your emotional well-being. Even with empathetic and present friends, some people need personal tools to regulate their nervous system, especially after trauma.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2: A good friend should be your main source of emotional regulation.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Expecting a friend to constantly "calm" your anxiety, dissociation or hypervigilance can generate dependency and exhaustion. PRENCs foster emotional autonomy, allowing for more balanced and sustainable friendships.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3: If you withdraw to use a PRENC instead of talking to your friends, you're being distant or cold.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Sometimes, using a PRENC (like breathing deeply or touching a transitional object) is the most respectful way to avoid impulsive reactions or emotional overload in the middle of a conversation. It's not rejection; it's self-regulation to be able to keep connecting afterwards.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4: PRENCs are "weird things" that push friends away due to discomfort.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Discomfort usually arises from lack of information, not from PRENC itself. Genuine friendships are usually willing to learn or, at least, respect your needs if explained clearly and without demands.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>5: If you need PRENC, you can't be a "present friend" for others.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> On the contrary: by regulating your own emotional state with PRENC, you avoid projecting anxiety, withdrawal or irritability. This allows you to listen, support and be more available for your friends in an authentic and sustainable way.
