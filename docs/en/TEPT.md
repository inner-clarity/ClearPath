# PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder)

## Clinical definition
**Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)** is a mental health condition that can develop after exposure to a traumatic event —that is, a situation where there was **real or perceived risk of death, serious injury, sexual violence, or extreme threat to personal integrity**. It is not a sign of spiritual weakness, lack of faith, or disobedience. It is a **comprehensible neurological response** to an experience that exceeds the nervous system's capacity to process it at the time.

## What distinguishes it from a normal stress reaction?
It's normal to feel fear, confusion, or restlessness after a dangerous event. The body activates its "alarm" system (fight, flight, immobility, or collapse) as a survival mechanism.  
In PTSD, **that system doesn't return to calm**. Symptoms persist beyond a month and interfere with daily life, relationships, and perception of self and the world.

## Essential diagnostic criteria (DSM-5)
For PTSD to be considered, **all** of the following symptom groups must be present for **more than a month**:

### 1. **Re-experiencing**
- *Flashbacks*: feeling of reliving the trauma as if it were happening again.
- Recurrent nightmares related to the event.
- Intense distress when encountering reminders (sounds, smells, dates, places).

> **Example**: A person who suffered a car accident feels panic when hearing brake sounds or getting into a car.

### 2. **Avoidance**
- Avoiding thoughts, emotions, or conversations about the trauma.
- Avoiding people, places, or activities that remind of the event.

> **Example**: Someone who was assaulted in a night park no longer leaves home after dark.

### 3. **Cognitive and mood alterations**
- Persistent negative beliefs ("I'm guilty", "No one can be trusted", "The world is completely dangerous").
- Dissociative amnesia (not remembering important parts of the trauma).
- Loss of interest in meaningful activities.
- Persistent feelings of fear, guilt, shame, or emotional emptiness.

### 4. **Arousal and reactivity alterations**
- Irritability or anger outbursts.
- Hypervigilance (being constantly "on alert").
- Being easily startled.
- Difficulty sleeping or concentrating.

## PTSD vs. Complex PTSD (C-PTSD)

### Classic PTSD
- Arises after **a single traumatic event or limited in time** (e.g., natural disaster, accident, assault).
- Symptoms focus on reaction to the specific event.

### Complex PTSD (C-PTSD)
- Arises from **prolonged or repeated interpersonal trauma**, especially in contexts where **there is no real possibility of escape** (e.g., childhood abuse, chronic neglect, prolonged abusive relationships, captivity).
- Includes **additional symptoms**:
  - Extreme difficulty regulating emotions (emotional storms or affective anesthesia).
  - Fragmented or negative sense of identity ("I don't know who I am", "I'm broken").
  - Chaotic relational patterns (extreme fear of abandonment, idealization followed by rejection).
  - Deep distrust in others or in life itself.

> **Comparative example**:  
> - *Classic PTSD*: A firefighter who rescued victims from a fire and now has nightmares when smelling smoke.  
> - *C-PTSD*: A person who grew up in a home with constant emotional violence and now, in their adult relationships, freezes at any disagreement, feels they "don't deserve love" and avoids intimacy for fear of being betrayed.

## Neurological basis: Why it's not "lack of faith"?
Trauma **physically changes the brain**:
- The **amygdala** (alarm center) becomes hyperactive → constant perception of danger.
- The **hippocampus** (responsible for contextualizing memories) shrinks → difficulty distinguishing "then" from "now".
- The **prefrontal cortex** (emotional regulation and decision-making) has reduced activity → less capacity to "calm down with logic".

This means that **trauma doesn't resolve just by "thinking positive" or "praying harder"**. It requires **safety, time, relational support, and often specialized clinical intervention**.

---

## Can it be healed?
Yes. Thanks to **neuroplasticity**, the brain and nervous system can reorganize. With proper support —trauma-focused therapy, safe relationships, emotional regulation strategies ([PRENC](PRENC.md))— many people not only reduce their symptoms, but rebuild a life with meaning, connection, and purpose.

> Healing doesn't always mean "forgetting," but **integrating the experience** so it no longer controls the present.

---

## What PTSD is NOT?
- ❌ It's not "madness" or "dangerousness".
- ❌ It's not divine punishment or a sign of lack of obedience.
- ❌ It doesn't heal with willpower alone or spiritual discipline (though faith can be a support resource).
- ❌ It's not the same as everyday anxiety or work stress.
