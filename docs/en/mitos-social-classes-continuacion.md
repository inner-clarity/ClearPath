# Myths about P.R.E.N.C. and social classes (continuation)

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is not limited to a social class, the erroneous idea that PTSD affects only certain social classes (for example, only poor people, or only rich people, etc.) However, when a person needs emotional regulation strategies to inhabit their body with peace, myths arise that confuse physiology with social classes. Below, **5 common myths** are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.

<details>
<summary><strong>1: PTSD in upper classes is not "real" because it's "drama" or "boredom".</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Minimizing someone's suffering because of their socioeconomic status is a form of class bias. PTSD diagnosed in wealthy people meets the same clinical criteria as in anyone else and requires the same respect and treatment.<br>
<strong>Risk:</strong> This bias can lead to invalidation of suffering in upper classes, perpetuating stigma and making access to appropriate treatments difficult.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2: Poor people exaggerate their symptoms to obtain social assistance.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> This belief reflects harmful and stigmatizing prejudices. Most people with PTSD, regardless of their class, avoid talking about their traumas due to shame or fear. Access to help is usually more difficult, not easier, in poverty contexts.<br>
<strong>Risk:</strong> This prejudice can lead to discrimination in mental health services and to perpetuation of stereotypes that prevent equitable access to treatments.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3: PTSD is more common in marginal areas, so it's not a "general" problem.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Although certain environments increase trauma exposure (like urban violence), PTSD is a global disorder affecting all social classes. Ignoring it in certain groups perpetuates invisibilization and lack of comprehensive mental health policies.<br>
<strong>Risk:</strong> This myth can lead to lack of comprehensive public policies and resource concentration only in certain areas, leaving other populations unprotected.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4: Upper-class people don't seek help, so they "don't have PTSD".</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Many wealthy people avoid seeking help due to fear of stigma, social pressure or self-sufficiency beliefs. This doesn't mean they don't have PTSD, but that their suffering remains hidden or manifests as anxiety, addictions or physical problems.<br>
<strong>Risk:</strong> This myth can lead to lack of PTSD recognition in upper classes, perpetuating silent suffering and delaying necessary interventions.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>5: Social class determines who "deserves" to have PTSD.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Trauma doesn't discriminate by income, education or status. PTSD is a valid human response to extreme suffering, and its recognition should be based on clinical evidence, not on social or economic prejudices.<br>
<strong>Risk:</strong> This myth can lead to hierarchization of suffering according to social class, perpetuating inequality and lack of equitable access to mental health services.
