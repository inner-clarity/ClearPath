# Myths about P.R.E.N.C. and love (Cont.)

In Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), P.R.E.N.C. can have an impact on aspects of life, debunking erroneous ideas related to the supposed incompatibility â€”or supposed absolute compatibilityâ€” between the use of unconventional emotional strategies and loving relationships. However, when a person needs emotional regulation strategies to inhabit their body with peace, myths arise that confuse physiology with the replacement of love. Below, **5 common myths** are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.

<details>
<summary><strong>1: If you depend on a PRENC, you can't give love fully.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> On the contrary: by regulating your own emotional system through PRENC, you reduce projection, reactivity and dissociation, allowing you to be more present, available and authentic in the relationship. Love flourishes better in internal stability.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2: PRENCs are only for being alone; they have no place in romantic love.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Some PRENCs are individual (like automatic writing), but others can be integrated into couple life: cooking in silence together, observing the night sky, using a shared transitional object or practicing synchronized breathing. Love is also nourished by co-regulation.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3: If your PRENC includes spiritual or symbolic elements, your "conventional" partner will never accept it.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Openness depends on communication, not on the type of PRENC. Many couples with different views find middle ground: respecting each other's personal space, participating partially or simply validating the emotional importance of the practice, even if they don't share it.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4: Needing PRENC in a relationship means there's a "lack of chemistry" or connection.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Chemistry doesn't prevent trauma or regulate the nervous system. Two deeply connected people can have pain histories that require additional tools. Using PRENCs demonstrates emotional maturity, not disconnection.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>5: True love doesn't need "techniques"; everything should flow naturally.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Love can be deep and authentic, but living with PTSD (or chronic emotional stress) is not "unnatural". Learning to navigate it with tools â€”conventional or notâ€” is an act of care towards oneself and towards the relationship. Mature love includes strategy, not just spontaneity.
