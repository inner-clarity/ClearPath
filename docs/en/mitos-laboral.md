# Myths about P.R.E.N.C. in workplace performance

In Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), P.R.E.N.C. can have an impact on aspects of life, the erroneous idea that PRENC can negatively affect or influence workplace performance. However, when a person needs emotional regulation strategies to inhabit their body with peace, myths arise that confuse physiology with workplace performance. Below, **5 common myths** are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.

<details>
<summary><strong>1: Using PRENC at work distracts and reduces productivity.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Many PRENCs (like conscious breathing, use of sensory objects or brief regulation pauses) are designed to be discreet and quick. Far from reducing productivity, they can prevent emotional crises, improve concentration and increase long-term job stability.<br>
<strong>Risk:</strong> This myth can lead to emotional regulation strategies being banned at work, increasing the risk of crises, absenteeism and deterioration of work performance.

<details>
<summary><strong>2: If someone needs PRENC at work, they're not "ready" to work.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Needing emotional regulation strategies doesn't indicate incapacity, but self-awareness and commitment to well-being. Many highly functional people with PTSD use PRENCs as part of their successful adaptation to the work environment.<br>
<strong>Risk:</strong> This prejudice can lead to workplace discrimination, limiting employment opportunities and perpetuating the stigmatization of people with mental health needs.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3: PRENCs are "excuses" not to fulfill work responsibilities.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> PRENCs are coping tools, not evasion. When used appropriately, they allow the person to stay present, regulated and capable of fulfilling their tasks, even in stressful environments.<br>
<strong>Risk:</strong> This misperception can create a hostile work environment that prevents the use of necessary strategies, increasing stress and the likelihood of emotional crises.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4: Only conventional treatments (like cognitive-behavioral therapy) are valid in the workplace.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Although conventional treatments are fundamental, many people complement their management with PRENCs that are culturally or personally meaningful to them. Effectiveness is measured by functional results, not just by the approach used.<br>
<strong>Risk:</strong> Limiting management options can reduce treatment effectiveness and create cultural barriers that prevent access to appropriate strategies.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>5: Using PRENC in public (like in the office) is unprofessional.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Professionalism is defined by ethics, responsibility and quality of work, not by the absence of mental health needs. Increasingly inclusive work environments recognize the diversity of self-regulation strategies as part of psychological accessibility.<br>
<strong>Risk:</strong> This stigma can lead people to hide their emotional regulation needs, increasing stress and reducing work effectiveness.
