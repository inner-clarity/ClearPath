# Myths about P.R.E.N.C. and fears (Cont.)

In Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), P.R.E.N.C. can have an impact on aspects of life, a statement that, although it contains part truth (PRENCs don't eliminate fears at the root like a magic cure), is often used to minimize their real value: regulating the response to fear, not eradicating the emotion itself. Below, **5 common myths** are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.

<details>
<summary><strong>1: If PRENCs worked against fear, they would already be part of conventional medicine.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Many PRENCs <em>are being integrated</em> into clinical approaches (like grounding in EMDR or use of sensory objects in occupational therapy). Conventional medicine advances slowly, but that doesn't invalidate what already helps thousands of people in their daily lives.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2: Fear is only overcome by facing it head-on, without "aids" like PRENCs.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Facing fear without regulation can retraumatize. The brain in alarm state doesn't learn; it only survives. PRENCs allow facing fear from a state of <em>relative safety</em>, which does generate learning and resilience.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3: PRENCs calm the body, but the mind still has fear, so they don't solve anything.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Body and mind are connected. Calming the body <em>changes the mental experience</em> of fear. When the heart stops racing and breathing normalizes, catastrophic thoughts lose strength. It's a physiological change that transforms perception.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4: If you need a PRENC to handle fear, you'll never be truly brave.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Courage is not absence of fear, but action despite fear. Using a PRENC to be able to act â€”take a step, ask for help, leave homeâ€” is an act of deep courage. Tools don't subtract merit; they amplify it.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>5: PRENCs only work with "small" fears, not with traumatic ones.</strong></summary>

<strong>Reality:</strong> Precisely in PTSD, where fear is intense and physiological, PRENCs are most needed. Flashbacks, hypervigilance or dissociation are not controlled by will, but with sensory and somatic strategies. PRENCs are essential allies in post-traumatic fear.
