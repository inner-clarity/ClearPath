# About P.R.E.N.C. and the life stage when they occur (continuation)

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is not limited to a life stage. It can arise at any moment, even decades after trauma, and can affect people of all ages and contexts. However, when a person needs emotional regulation strategies to inhabit their body with peace, myths arise that confuse physiology with spirituality. Below, **5 common myths** are debunked with clinical foundation and alignment with InnerSight principles.

<details>
<summary><strong>1: PTSD is exclusive to war veterans or people who have lived through wars.</strong></summary>

**Reality:** Any traumatic event â€”like accidents, abuse, natural disasters, domestic violence or serious medical diagnosesâ€” can cause PTSD, regardless of age or life context.<br>
**Risk:** This prejudice can invisibilize the suffering of people outside the war sphere and limit access to support for other types of victims.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2: Elderly people don't develop PTSD because they "already overcame everything".</strong></summary>

**Reality:** Aging doesn't immunize against PTSD. In fact, in old age previously untreated symptoms may emerge, especially when daily distractions (like work) decrease.<br>
**Risk:** Underestimating PTSD in old age prevents adequate care and can worsen isolation, depression or quality of life deterioration in elderly adults.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3: If trauma occurred in childhood, PTSD can only be diagnosed in childhood.</strong></summary>

**Reality:** Many adults are diagnosed with complex PTSD derived from childhood traumas that were not identified or treated in time.<br>
**Risk:** Ignoring this reality delays diagnosis, complicates recovery and perpetuates the cycle of discomfort into adulthood.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4: PTSD cannot appear in old age if it never presented before.</strong></summary>

**Reality:** Traumatic events in old age â€”like serious falls, intensive hospitalizations or violent death of a loved oneâ€” can trigger PTSD even in people who had never experienced it.<br>
**Risk:** Not paying attention to new symptoms in old age increases the risk that PTSD goes unnoticed and is not treated adequately.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>5: PTSD can only develop if trauma occurs in a "vulnerable" stage of life.</strong></summary>

**Reality:** There is no "exclusive vulnerable stage". Vulnerability to PTSD depends on biological, psychological and social factors, not on a specific time window.<br>
**Risk:** This myth can lead to underestimating the importance of support for traumas lived outside those supposed "vulnerable stages", denying attention and understanding.
